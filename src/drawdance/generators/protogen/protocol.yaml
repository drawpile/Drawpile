             Server command message

             This is a general purpose message for sending commands to the server
             and receiving replies. This is used for (among other things):

             - the login handshake
             - setting session parameters (e.g. max user count and password)
             - sending administration commands (e.g. kick user)
    fields:
        # In Drawpile's protocol.yaml, this uses bytes instead of utf8.
        # But it's really a JSON string, so we change it to get something
        # that's properly typed and null-terminated.

             Ping message

             This is used for latency measurement as well as a keepalive. Normally, the client
             should be the one to send the ping messages.

             The server should return a Ping with the is_pong flag set
    fields:

             This message is used when closing the connection gracefully. The message queue

             The client may indicate support for this during login, in which
             case the server will send this kind of message if it did not send
             anything else for a while. This is to make sure the client doesn't
             run into an idle timeout if its upload queue is too saturated to
             actually manage sending out a ping.

             This message sets the users who have operator status. It can be
             sent by users who are already operators or by the server (user id=0).

             The list of operators implicitly contains the user who sends the
             message, thus users cannot deop themselves.

             The server sanitizes the ID list so, when distributed to other users,
             it does not contain any duplicates or non-existing users and can be trusted
             without checking the access control list.

             List of trusted users

             This message sets the list of user who have been tagged as trusted,
             but who are not operators. The meaning of "trusted" is a mostly
             clientside concept, but the session can be configured to allow trusted
             users access to some operator commands. (Deputies)

             This command can be sent by operators or by the server (ctx=0).

             The server sanitizes the ID list so, when distributed to other users,
             it does not contain any duplicates or non-existing users and can be trusted
             without checking the access control list.

             This message marks the point in the session history where a soft reset occurs.
             A thick-server performs an internal soft-reset when a user joins.

             All users should truncate their own session history when receiving this message,
             since undos cannot cross the reset boundary.

             Note. This message type was added in protocol 4.21.2 (v. 2.1.0). For backward compatiblity,
             the server will not send any private messages from itself; it will only relay them from
             other users. In version 3.0, this should be merged with the normal Chat message.

             Private messages always bypass the session history.

             Note. This is a META message, since this is used for a temporary visual effect only,
             and thus doesn't affect the actual canvas content.

             Merging an annotation is done by rendering the annotation item to

             Unlike PutImage, this replaces an entire tile directly without any
             blending. This command is typically used during canvas
             initialization to set the initial content.

             PutTile can target sublayers as well. This is used when generating
             a reset image with incomplete indirect strokes. Sending a PenUp
             command will merge the sublayer.

             Draw MyPaint brush dabs in "normal and eraser" or "pigment and
             eraser" mode, the regular modes of MyPaint brushes as used in
             MyPaint itself.

             The lowest flag bit indicates that this message uses pigment and
             eraser instead of normal and eraser mode. The top 5 bits indicate
             the selection ID to use for masking.

             If the highest bit (0x80) of the mode field is not set, it is
             treated as the number of posterization colors. If it is set, the
             first two bits decide the paint and blend mode of this stroke: 0x0
             means direct with Normal and Eraser mode, 0x1 means soft indirect
             with Normal mode, 0x2 means soft indirect with Recolor mode and 0x3
             means soft indirect with Erase mode. This is for backward
             compatibility with the 2.2 protocol, 2.3 uses the mypaintdabsblend
             message instead.

LayerTreeCreate:

             Create a new layer

             A session starts with zero layers, so a layer creation command is typically
             the second command to be sent, right after setting the canvas size.

             The layer ID must be prefixed with the context ID of the user creating it.
             This allows the client to choose the layer ID without worrying about
             clashes. In multiuser mode the ACL filter validates the prefix for all new layers.

             If the `source` field is nonzero, a copy of the source layer is made.
             Otherwise, either a blank new bitmap or a group layer is created.
             When copying a group, the group's layers are assigned new IDs sequentally,
             starting from the group ID, using the group IDs user prefix.

             If the `target` field is nonzero, the newly created layer will be
             insert above that layer or group, or into that group. If zero,
             the layer will be added to the top of the root group.

             The following flags can be used with layer creation:
             - GROUP: a group layer is created (ignored if `source` is set)
             - INTO: the new layer will be added to the top to the `target` group.
                     The target must be nonzero.

             If layer controls are locked, this command requires session operator privileges.

TransformRegion:

             Transform an area, optionally moving it between two layers.

             This is used to implement selection moving. It is equivalent
             to doing two PutImages: the first to mask away the original
             selection and the other to paste the selection to a new location.

             This command packages that into a single action that is more
             bandwidth efficient and can be used even when PutImages in general
             are locked, since it's not introducing any new pixels onto the canvas.

             Internally, the paint engine performs the following steps:

             2. Erase selected pixels from the source layer
             3. Composite transformed buffer onto the target layer

             The pixel selection is determined by the mask bitmap. The mask
             is DEFLATEd 8 bit alpha.

             For axis aligned rectangle selections, no bitmap is necessary.

             `source_id` as the layer id, `source_index` will be ignored. If the

             Set (clobber) flags for layers inside of a key frame.

             This takes a list of (layer id, flags) pairs. If a layer appears
             multiple times, only the first occurrence will apply. If a layer
             doesn't exist or the flags value is 0, it will be ignored. Unknown
             flags will be retained for forward-compatibility.

             Used flags are:

             * `0x1` hidden: hides a layer in the key frame. Children can
               override being hidden by setting the revealed flag on them.

             * `0x2` revealed: overrides the hidden state given by a parent
               group, making it visible again. Putting both hidden and revealed
               on the same layer cancels each other out and will act like
               neither is set.

        Modify selection, either by a rectangle or a pixel mask.

        The selection_id specifies which of the user's selections is affected.
        An id of 0 is invalid.

        The mask is delta-encoded, zstd-compressed 8 bit alpha. If absent, this
        fills the entire rectangle instead.

        This message is never sent over the network, it's matched by LocalMatch
        messages instead and selections are synchronized to the remote using

    comment: |
        A command that is sent over the network just to match it with another
        message in the local fork. It has no effect in itself. This is currently
        used for selections, which only have an effect on the local user and
        other users don't need to bother with processing them.

        The type describes the message type this is matched with and the
        contents of data depend on that type being matched. It usually contains
        the same stuff as the matched message, minus any variable-length
        buffers, where only the size is sent along, since that's good enough for
        getting a match in practice.

        Strictly speaking, this is not compatible with the 2.2 protocol and
        clients before version 2.2.2 don't understand it. However, since it
        doesn't have any effect for other users, it doesn't cause desync, so we
        accept it anyway. In sessions on the builtin server, a PutImage message
        with an invalid blend mode is used instead.

        Synchronizes a tile from a local selection into a remote one. The
        selection id must be 128 or higher.

        The mask is zstd-compressed, delta-encoded 8 bit alpha. A zero-length
        mask will make the tile blank. A mask with a single zero byte will make
        the tile fully opaque.  When the column and row are both 0xffff and the
        mask has a length of zero, the selection is cleared instead.

        This command isn't rolled back by undos.
