             Server command message

             This is a general purpose message for sending commands to the server
             and receiving replies. This is used for (among other things):

             - the login handshake
             - setting session parameters (e.g. max user count and password)
             - sending administration commands (e.g. kick user)
    fields:
        # In Drawpile's protocol.yaml, this uses bytes instead of utf8.
        # But it's really a JSON string, so we change it to get something
        # that's properly typed and null-terminated.

             Ping message

             This is used for latency measurement as well as a keepalive. Normally, the client
             should be the one to send the ping messages.

             The server should return a Ping with the is_pong flag set
    fields:

             This message is sent only by the server. Upon receiving this message,

             This message sets the users who have operator status. It can be
             sent by users who are already operators or by the server (user id=0).

             The list of operators implicitly contains the user who sends the
             message, thus users cannot deop themselves.

             The server sanitizes the ID list so, when distributed to other users,
             it does not contain any duplicates or non-existing users and can be trusted
             without checking the access control list.

             List of trusted users

             This message sets the list of user who have been tagged as trusted,
             but who are not operators. The meaning of "trusted" is a mostly
             clientside concept, but the session can be configured to allow trusted
             users access to some operator commands. (Deputies)

             This command can be sent by operators or by the server (ctx=0).

             The server sanitizes the ID list so, when distributed to other users,
             it does not contain any duplicates or non-existing users and can be trusted

             This message marks the point in the session history where a soft reset occurs.
             A thick-server performs an internal soft-reset when a user joins.

             All users should truncate their own session history when receiving this message,

             Note. This message type was added in protocol 4.21.2 (v. 2.1.0). For backward compatiblity,
             the server will not send any private messages from itself; it will only relay them from
             other users. In version 3.0, this should be merged with the normal Chat message.

             Private messages always bypass the session history.

             Change layer access control list

             This is an opaque meta command. It is used to set the general layer lock
             as well as give exclusive access to selected users.

             When the OWNLAYERS mode is set, any user can use this to change the ACLs on layers they themselves
             have created (identified by the ID prefix.)

             Using layer ID 0 sets or clears a general canvaswide lock. The tier and exclusive user list is not
             used in this case.

             The eighth bit of the flags field (0x80) indicates whether the layer is locked in general.
             The first three bits (0x07) indicate the access tier level.

             This affects the size of all existing and future layers.

             The new canvas size is relative to the old one. The four adjustement
             parameters extend or retract their respective borders.
             Initial canvas resize should be (0, w, h, 0).

    name: newlayer
    comment: |
             Create a new layer

             A session starts with zero layers, so a layer creation command is typically
             the second command to be sent, right after setting the canvas size.

             The layer ID must be prefixed with the context ID of the user creating it.
             This allows the client to choose the layer ID without worrying about
             clashes. In multiuser mode the ACL filter validates the prefix for all new layers.

             If the `source` field is nonzero, a copy of the source layer is made.
             Otherwise, either a blank new bitmap or a group layer is created.
             When copying a group, the group's layers are assigned new IDs sequentally,
             starting from the group ID, using the group IDs user prefix.

             If the `target` field is nonzero, the newly created layer will be
             insert above that layer or group, or into that group. If zero,
             the layer will be added to the top of the root group.

             The following flags can be used with layer creation:
             - GROUP: a group layer is created (ignored if `source` is set)
             - INTO: the new layer will be added to the top to the `target` group.
                     The target must be nonzero.

             If layer controls are locked, this command requires session operator privileges.
    fields:
        - id u16: hex
        - source u16: hex

             If the target layer is locked, this command requires session operator privileges.

             Specifying a sublayer requires session operator privileges. Currently, it is used
             only when sublayers are needed at canvas initialization.

             Note: the `fixed` flag is unused since version 2.2. It's functionality is replaced

             The layer tree of the given group (0 means whole tree) will be reordered
             according to the given order.
             The order should describe a tree using (child count, layer ID) pairs.

             For example (indented for clarity):

               2, 1,
                 0, 10,
                 0, 11,
               0, 2,

                 1, 30,
                   0, 31
                 0, 32

              Each layer in the group must be listed exactly once in the new order,
              or the command will be rejected.

             Move (and transform) a region of a layer.

             This is used to implement selection moving. It is equivalent
             to doing two PutImages: the first to mask away the original
             selection and the other to paste the selection to a new location.

             This command packages that into a single action that is more
             bandwidth efficient and can be used even when PutImages in general
             are locked, since it's not introducing any new pixels onto the canvas.

             Internally, the paint engine performs the following steps:
             1. Copy selected pixels to a buffer
             2. Erase selected pixels from the layer
             3. Composite transformed buffer onto the layer

             The pixel selection is determined by the mask bitmap. The mask
             is DEFLATEd 1 bit per pixel bitmap data.
             For axis aligned rectangle selections, no bitmap is necessary.

PutTile:

    comment: |
             Set the content of a tile

             Unlike PutImage, this replaces an entire tile directly without any blending.
             This command is typically used during canvas initialization to set the initial content.

             PutTile can target sublayers as well. This is used when generating a reset image
             with incomplete indirect strokes. Sending a PenUp command will merge the sublayer.
    fields:
        - layer u16: hex
        - sublayer u8
        - last_touch u8
        - col u16
        - row u16

             Set the canvas background tile

             If the payload is exactly 4 bytes long, it should be interpreted as a solid background color.
             Otherwise, it is the DEFLATED tile bitmap
    fields:
        - image bytes

             Draw classic brush dabs

             A simple delta compression scheme is used.
             The coordinates of each dab are relative to the previous dab.
             The coordinate system has 1/4 pixel resolution. Divide by 4.0 before use.
             The size field is the brush diameter multiplied by 256.
    fields:
        - layer u16: hex
        - x i32: div4
        - y i32: div4
        - color argb32
        - mode blendmode
        - dabs struct:
          name: ClassicDab
          fields:
            - x i8: div4

             Draw round pixel brush dabs

             The same kind of delta compression is used as in classicdabs,
             but the fields all have integer precision.
    fields:
        - layer u16: hex
        - x i32
        - y i32
        - color argb32

    comment: |
             Move a rectangular area on a layer.

             A mask image can be given to mask out part of the region
             to support non-rectangular selections.

             Source and target rects may be (partially) outside the canvas.
    fields:
      - layer u16: hex
      - source u16: hex
      - sx i32
      - sy i32

             Set a document metadata field (integer type)

             These typically don't have an immediate visual effect,
             but these fields are part of the document, like the pixel content
             or the annotations.
    fields:
        - field enum:
          name: MetadataInt
          variants:
              - Dpix
              - Dpiy

    comment: |
             Set the layers included in the given animation frame

             The frame number must be between zero and last frame number + 1.

             If the `insert` flag is true, the frame will be inserted at the given
             position rather than replacing the existing frame.
    fields:
        - frame u16
        - insert bool
        - layers vec_u16: hex
          max_len: 12
