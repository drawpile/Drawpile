             Server command message

             This is a general purpose message for sending commands to the server
             and receiving replies. This is used for (among other things):

             - the login handshake
             - setting session parameters (e.g. max user count and password)
             - sending administration commands (e.g. kick user)
    fields:
        # In Drawpile's protocol.yaml, this uses bytes instead of utf8.
        # But it's really a JSON string, so we change it to get something
        # that's properly typed and null-terminated.

             Ping message

             This is used for latency measurement as well as a keepalive. Normally, the client
             should be the one to send the ping messages.

             The server should return a Ping with the is_pong flag set
    fields:

             This message sets the users who have operator status. It can be
             sent by users who are already operators or by the server (user id=0).

             The list of operators implicitly contains the user who sends the
             message, thus users cannot deop themselves.

             The server sanitizes the ID list so, when distributed to other users,
             it does not contain any duplicates or non-existing users and can be trusted
             without checking the access control list.

             List of trusted users

             This message sets the list of user who have been tagged as trusted,
             but who are not operators. The meaning of "trusted" is a mostly
             clientside concept, but the session can be configured to allow trusted
             users access to some operator commands. (Deputies)

             This command can be sent by operators or by the server (ctx=0).

             The server sanitizes the ID list so, when distributed to other users,
             it does not contain any duplicates or non-existing users and can be trusted
             without checking the access control list.

             the server will not send any private messages from itself; it will only relay them from
             other users. In version 3.0, this should be merged with the normal Chat message.

             This is an opaque meta command. It is used to set the general layer lock
             as well as give exclusive access to selected users.

             When the OWNLAYERS mode is set, any user can use this to change the ACLs on layers they themselves
             have created (identified by the ID prefix.)

             Using layer ID 0 sets or clears a general canvaswide lock. The tier and exclusive user list is not
             used in this case.

             The eighth bit of the flags field (0x80) indicates whether the layer is locked in general.
             The first three bits (0x07) indicate the access tier level.

             This is the first command that must be sent to initialize the session.

             This affects the size of all existing and future layers.

             The new canvas size is relative to the old one. The four adjustement
             parameters extend or retract their respective borders.
             Initial canvas resize should be (0, w, h, 0).

LayerCreate:

    name: newlayer
    comment: |
             Layer creation command (legacy, subsumed by LayerTreeCreate)

             A session starts with zero layers, so a layer creation command is typically
             the second command to be sent, right after setting the canvas size.

             The layer ID must be prefixed with the context ID of the user creating it.
             This allows users to choose the layer ID themselves without worrying about
             clashes. In single user mode, the client can assign IDs as it pleases,
             but in multiuser mode the server validates the prefix for all new layers.

             The following flags can be used with layer creation:
             - COPY   -- a copy of the Source layer is made, rather than a blank layer
             - INSERT -- the new layer is inserted above the Source layer. Source 0 means
                         the layer will be placed bottom-most on the stack

             The Source layer ID should be zero when COPY or INSERT flags are not used.
             When COPY is used, it should refer to an existing layer. Copy commands
             referring to missing layers are dropped.
             When INSERT is used, referring to 0 or a nonexistent layer places
             the new layer at the bottom of the stack.

             If layer controls are locked, this command requires session operator privileges.
    fields:
        - id u16: hex

             If the target layer is locked, this command requires session operator privileges.

             Specifying a sublayer requires session operator privileges. Currently, it is used
             only when sublayers are needed at canvas initialization.

             Note: the `fixed` flag is unused since version 2.2. It's functionality is replaced

LayerOrder:

    comment: |
             Layer order change command (legacy, subsumed by LayerTreeMove)

             New layers are always added to the top of the stack.
             This command includes a list of layer IDs that define the new stacking order.

             An order change should list all layers in the stack, but due to synchronization issues, that
             is not always possible.
             The layer order should therefore be sanitized by removing all layers not in the current layer stack
             and adding all missing layers to the end in their current relative order.

             For example: if the current stack is [1,2,3,4,5] and the client receives
             a reordering command [3,4,1], the missing layers are appended: [3,4,1,2,5].

             If layer controls are locked, this command requires session operator privileges.

             to the layer below it. Merging the bottom-most layer does nothing.

             If the current layer or layer controls in general are locked, this command
             requires session operator privileges.

    comment: |
             Move (and transform) a region of a layer (legacy, subsumed by TransformRegion)

             This is used to implement selection moving. It is equivalent
             to doing two PutImages: the first to mask away the original
             selection and the other to paste the selection to a new location.

             This command packages that into a single action that is more
             bandwidth efficient and can be used even when PutImages in general
             are locked, since it's not introducing any new pixels onto the canvas.

             Internally, the paint engine performs the following steps:
             1. Copy selected pixels to a buffer
             2. Erase selected pixels from the layer
             3. Composite transformed buffer onto the layer

             The pixel selection is determined by the mask bitmap. The mask
             is DEFLATEd 1 bit per pixel bitmap data.

             For axis aligned rectangle selections, no bitmap is necessary.

PutTile:

             Set the content of a tile

             Unlike PutImage, this replaces an entire tile directly without any blending.
             This command is typically used during canvas initialization to set the initial content.

             PutTile can target sublayers as well. This is used when generating a reset image
             with incomplete indirect strokes. Sending a PenUp command will merge the sublayer.

             Draw classic brush dabs

             A simple delta compression scheme is used.
             The coordinates of each dab are relative to the previous dab.
             The coordinate system has 1/4 pixel resolution. Divide by 4.0 before use.
             The size field is the brush diameter multiplied by 256.

LayerTreeCreate:
    id: 162
    comment: |
             Create a new layer

             A session starts with zero layers, so a layer creation command is typically
             the second command to be sent, right after setting the canvas size.

             The layer ID must be prefixed with the context ID of the user creating it.
             This allows the client to choose the layer ID without worrying about
             clashes. In multiuser mode the ACL filter validates the prefix for all new layers.

             If the `source` field is nonzero, a copy of the source layer is made.
             Otherwise, either a blank new bitmap or a group layer is created.
             When copying a group, the group's layers are assigned new IDs sequentally,
             starting from the group ID, using the group IDs user prefix.

             If the `target` field is nonzero, the newly created layer will be
             insert above that layer or group, or into that group. If zero,
             the layer will be added to the top of the root group.

             The following flags can be used with layer creation:
             - GROUP: a group layer is created (ignored if `source` is set)
             - INTO: the new layer will be added to the top to the `target` group.
                     The target must be nonzero.

             If layer controls are locked, this command requires session operator privileges.
    fields:
        - id u16: hex
        - source u16: hex
        - target u16: hex
        - fill argb32
        - flags flags: [group, into]

LayerTreeMove:
    id: 163
    comment: |
             Reorder a layer

             Moves the given layer into the given parent group or into the root
             if given 0. It will be placed either below the given sibling or at
             the bottom if given 0. An invalid move, such as because the parent
             is missing or the sibling isn't part of the parent group, will not
             be executed at all, no fallback is attempted.

             The user is allowed to move a layer if they can edit both it and
             the parent. Moving into the parent group is allowed if the user has
             would be allowed to create a layer there (which is always, since
             that's currently conflated with being allowed to edit layers.)

LayerTreeDelete:
    id: 164
    comment: |
             Delete a layer

             If the merge to attribute is nonzero, the contents of the layer is merged
             to the layer with the given ID. If the id and merge id both refer to
             the same layer group, that group is collapsed into a layer.

             If the current layer or layer controls in general are locked, this command
             requires session operator privileges.
    fields:
        - id u16: hex

TransformRegion:
    id: 165
    comment: |
             Transform an area, optionally moving it between two layers.

             This is used to implement selection moving. It is equivalent
             to doing two PutImages: the first to mask away the original
             selection and the other to paste the selection to a new location.

             This command packages that into a single action that is more
             bandwidth efficient and can be used even when PutImages in general
             are locked, since it's not introducing any new pixels onto the canvas.

             Internally, the paint engine performs the following steps:
             1. Copy selected pixels to a buffer
             2. Erase selected pixels from the source layer
             3. Composite transformed buffer onto the target layer

             The pixel selection is determined by the mask bitmap. The mask
             is DEFLATEd 8 bit alpha.

             For axis aligned rectangle selections, no bitmap is necessary.

             If there's no key frame at the given frame index, it will be
             created, otherwise it will be clobbered. The layer must exist and
             the frame index must be within the document's frame count.

             If the source is `Layer`, a new key frame will be created with
             `source_id` as the layer id, `source_index` will be ignored. If the
             source is `KeyFrame`, the key frame is copied from the key frame at

    comment: |
             Set (clobber) flags for layers inside of a key frame.

             This takes a list of (layer id, flags) pairs. If a layer appears
             multiple times, only the first occurrence will apply. If a layer
             doesn't exist or the flags value is 0, it will be ignored. Unknown
             flags will be retained for forward-compatibility.

             Used flags are:

             * `0x1` hidden: hides a layer in the key frame. Children can
               override being hidden by setting the revealed flag on them.

             * `0x2` revealed: overrides the hidden state given by a parent
               group, making it visible again. Putting both hidden and revealed
               on the same layer cancels each other out and will act like
               neither is set.
