To compile DrawPile, Qt 4.2 or newer is required.

Build
-----

# Create build directory:

$ mkdir path/to/build    # inside our outside the source tree
$ cd path/to/build

# Configure: one of the following:

$ cmake path/to/src      # command-line
$ ccmake path/to/src     # text-based UI
$ cmake-gui path/to/src  # GUI

# Build:

$ make

The executables are generated in the build/bin directory. You can run them from there,
or install them (see below).

Options
-------

The configuration step supports some options:

SERVER=off   Don't build the stand-alone server.
DEBUG=on     Enable debugging features

If using cmake, you can pass them on the command-line with -D (example: cmake -DSERVER=off). If using ccmake or cmake-gui, you can set them in the UI.

Install
-------

make install
