Unreleased Version 2.3.0-pre
 * Fix: Unpremultiply alpha values when exporting to animated WEBP so that partially transparent pixels come out looking correct.
 * Fix: Make the preferences menu item on macOS open the preferences again.
 * Fix: Make mouse wheel to adjust brush sizes not skip over small values on wheels that make big steps. Thanks Meiren for reporting.
 * Fix: Make zoom tool detect clicks properly, rather than detecting tiny motions as a rectangle to zoom into. Thanks Scruff for reporting.
 * Fix: Make freehand tool icon appear again if starting up with the eraser selected. Thanks Meiren for reporting.
 * Fix: Make software renderers handle canvas sizes with dimensions beyond 32767 pixels properly. Thanks Ben for reporting.
 * Fix: Open ORA files with width or height greater than 32767 pixels. Thanks Nimono for reporting.
 * Feature: Make true /roll messages in chat have a blue tint to make cheating more difficult. They're also translatable now, rather than always being in English. Thanks KosmonautKat, lambda20xx and Potete for suggesting.
 * Feature: Allow "blocking" of layers. It works like censoring a layer, but the censor is only visible to you. It lets you hide stuff you don't want to see, but still be aware that it's there so you don't draw over other people's art.
 * Fix: Make layer clipping onto pass-through groups work the same as it does in other programs (that is, make it not clip.)
 * Feature: Anti-overflow fill for brushes. Thanks Ausjamcian, Axocrat and Null for suggesting.
 * Feature: Exit Drawpile when the last window is closed on macOS, like on all other systems. You can reenable this behavior in the user interface preferences if you want it back.
 * Fix: Make clicking with touchpad not trigger touch color picker.
 * Fix: Properly enable or disable session permission boxes and sliders according to compatibility mode and operator status.
 * Fix: Make key frame visibility attributes work properly in compatibility mode.
 * Server Feature: Fast reconnects. Clients now remember the state of the history when they got disconnected and skip ahead in the catchup sequence if possible. Thanks Bluestrings for testing.
 * Server Fix: Don't restrict binary (.dprec) templates to the current version.
 * Fix: Disable native message boxes, they're broken on macOS Tahoe and don't add anything except an inconsistent appearance.
 * Fix: Make start, login, invite and numerous other dialogs have proper title bars on macOS, rather than being those weird sheets. Thanks Axocrat for reporting.
 * Fix: Don't show duplicate full screen action in view menu on macOS.
 * Fix: Make window maximized when leaving full screen on macOS, rather than crumpling it down to a small size and messing up the docks arrangement.
 * Feature: Allow closing modal dialogs on macOS using Command+Q. Thanks Axocrat for suggesting.
 * Feature: Increase/decrease key frame exposure actions for all visible tracks, bound to Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Plus/Minus by default. This lets you shift frames on multiple frames at once, rather than having to move each track individually.
 * Removed Server Feature: Socket activation. Attempting to pass sockets via systemd now just raises an error and tells you to uninstall drawpile-srv.socket. This was a pretty obscure feature that apparently wasn't working properly anyway and only ever seems to get used unintentionally. Thanks Bluestrings for reporting.
 * Feature: Binary interpolation mode for transforms. Works like Bilinear, but tries to keep the opacity of pixels the same so that you can scale stuff drawn with a binary brush without making it all blurry. Thanks TGS for suggesting.
 * Fix: Properly reconnect to sessions when using an invite code, rather than asking for a password the second time around.
 * Fix: Properly reconnect when using a WebSocket URL, rather than replacing the path inappropriately.
 * Fix: Don't incorrectly redo already gone undone commands after a series of undos and redos. Thanks Sinamer for reporting.
 * Feature: Don't ask for login method, username and password again when reconnecting. Thanks Meru for reporting.
 * Feature: Don't show chat until connecting to a session and remember the size of it even when it was hidden.
 * Feature: Send button in chat, for virtual keyboards where hitting return is inconvenient.
 * Feature: Make drawpile-timelapse command-line tool fill the background with the canvas background color instead of black.
 * Server Fix: Apply archive and size limit setting immediately, not only when a session is started.
 * Server Feature: Allow toggling archive mode on individual sessions instead of using server default. Thanks Bluestrings for suggesting.
 * Server Fix: Properly treat autoreset threshold with zero value as no autoreset.
 * Server Feature: Add server setting for a minimum autoreset threshold, to avoid users setting it to a too low value and causing excessive resets. Thanks Bluestrings for suggesting.
 * Server Feature: Allow overriding session size limit for individual sessions. Thanks Bluestrings for suggesting.
 * Fix: Properly check for session reset size so that oversized resets don't end up in disconnects.
 * Fix: Show a proper error message when a manual reset fails, rather than claiming that an auto-reset failed.
 * Fix: Handle reordering of layers with large ids properly. This was only a problem in the UI, it does not cause desync. Thanks Bluesflying for reporting.
 * Fix: Remove accessibility features, because they cause crashes on macOS and possibly also other operating systems even though Drawpile doesn't use them. This is a patch to Qt. Thanks kal^-^ for reporting.
 * Feature: Long-press to open context menus. Enabled by default on Android and in the browser. Can be toggled in the user interface preferences.
 * Fix: Make sliders less annoying: double-clicking now starts editing instead of clicking and holding, hitting Escape now unfocuses the slider and sliders now no longer block shortcuts keys that wouldn't have any effect on them. Thanks Blozzom and incoheart for reporting.
 * Fix: Make drawpile-cmd actually write to stdout when passing "-" as the output file, like the help claims. Thanks incoheart for reporting.
 * Feature: Higher-quality zoom using the hardware renderer. Thanks cromachina for contributing.
 * Fix: Allow right-clicking on the lasso fill and gradient tools to cancel them even if right-click is bound to a canvas shortcut. Thanks Blozzom for reporting.
 * Feature: Allow for fractional framerates instead of only allowing whole numbers.
 * Fix: Reset flipbook crop, speed nad frame range when a different canvas is loaded.
 * Feature: Make the timeline use a frame range instead of always strictly constraining it from 1 to the maximum frame count and chomping away any frames beyond the end.
 * Fix: Clear layer selection when selecting a blank frame. Thanks Pumpkin for reporting.
 * Fix: Properly persist changes to blend, alpha preserve and erase modes when they're changed on the brush dock. Thanks cromachina for reporting.
 * Fix: Don't disconnect brush shortcuts when changing other shortcuts. Thanks cromachina for reporting.
 * Feature: Allow double-clicking on empty timeline frames to create key frames and on the header to edit the framerate and frame range. Thanks Greendyno for suggesting.
 * Feature: Start blank canvases with a single timeline track pre-created, similar to how it works with layers.
 * Feature: Allow joining sessions if there's only a minor protocol incompatibility. An outdated client like this won't handle any new features and therefore their canvas may desynchronize, so they can't reset or compress it.
 * Feature: Make compiling Drawpile with WebSocket support mandatory. This avoids accidentally ending up with an application that's unable to connect to certain servers.

2025-08-14 Version 2.3.0-beta.3
 * Fix: Allow putting labels on a blank brush thumbnail. Thanks hipofiz for reporting.
 * Feature: Pixel art input for pixel brushes, turns off all smoothing and makes the inputs apply immediately. Thanks Ben, dAVePAGE and Nilifin for reporting.
 * Fix: Remove alpha lock and erase toggle buttons when using the eraser tool.
 * Fix: Disable the "modern" WASAPI audio backend, because on some devices it causes crashes in the depths of Windows, makes drag and drop stop working or other strange effects. Thanks Ben, CrustStuff, dAVePAGE and Momo for reporting various different incarnations of this problem.

2025-08-08 Version 2.3.0-beta.2
 * Fix: Make start dialog not flicker briefly on some systems.
 * Removed Feature: Use the same logo for the application, too distracting evidently.
 * Fix: Make hosting session with a password work, it did not get picked up sometimes. Thanks Bluestrings for reporting.

2025-08-07 Version 2.3.0-beta.1
 * Removed Feature: Compatibility with the old 2.1 versions, which was originally released 6 years ago. 2.3 is compatible with 2.2 instead.
 * Feature: Add Edit > Lightness/Darkness to Alpha action. Thanks Ben for suggesting.
 * Feature: Allow switching annotation rendering between vector, smooth and pixel fonts. Thanks cvrsoiioo4 for suggesting.
 * Feature: "Clip to layer below" toggle on layers, for people used to that way of alpha preserving. Will be loaded from and saved to PSD files.
 * Fix: Change the dptxt recording format to use JSON to represent message bodies instead of a bespoke format that sometimes doesn't round-trip properly.
 * Feature: "Inherit alpha" toggle on layers and "preserve alpha" toggle on tools, for people used to that way of alpha preserving from Krita. You can toggle automatic alpha preserverance in the user interface preferences. Thanks Bubble for testing.
 * Feature: "Greater Density" blend mode, which will only draw where it will increase opacity. Works like "Greater" in Krita and "Compare Density" in CSP, minus the glitches when you use different colors. Thanks Annoy suggesting.
 * Feature: "Marker" blend mode, which will only increase opacity, but always change the color. Works like the marker in SAI and sorta similar to "Alpha Darken" in Krita, minus the glitches for different colors again. Thanks cromachina for suggesting.
 * Fix: Make indirect wash mode actually work like it's supposed to, without causing weird effects for soft brushes. The previous mode is now available as a separate paint mode.
 * Feature: Bring back the indirect normal mode from Drawpile 2.1 as another paint mode option.
 * Feature: Allow using blend modes with MyPaint brushes, rather than restricting them to normal, recolor and erase.
 * Feature: Allow using MyPaint brush color dynamics in indirect mode.
 * Feature: Remember who changed tiles across session resets and compressing the canvas. Thanks Bluestrings for suggesting and callaa for originally implementing it before it fell off again for compatibility.
 * Fix: Don't displace annotations when resizing the canvas to the left or top.
 * Feature: Make the Shine (SAI) blend mode work exactly like in SAI, even with alpha preserve off. Thanks cromachina for providing the logic for this.
 * Feature: Implement more blend modes: Vivid Light, Pin Light, Difference, Darker Color, Lighter Color, Shade (SAI), Shade/Shine (SAI), Burn (SAI), Dodge (SAI), Burn/Dodge (SAI), Hard Mix (SAI) and Difference (SAI). Thanks cromachina for providing the logic for the SAI blend modes.
 * Feature: Increase maximum brush size to 1000. Session operators can limit this and the default limit for non-operators is 255. Thanks ariqhadiyan and TGS for suggesting.
 * Fix: Make MyPaint brush outline more accurate to the actual maximum size of the brush (although it still can't account for crazier brushes.)
 * Feature: Pigment blend mode, which allows for more realistic color mixing. Session operators can restrict this mode and by default it's only enabled for operators, since it's very performance-intensive. Thanks chaitae for suggesting, username and xxx for testing.
 * Feature: Increase maximum layer count to 32767 per user, up from the previous 256. Operators can also now limit the layer count in the session settings. Thanks haxekhaex2 for suggesting.
 * Feature: Allow drawing on selections via Selection → Draw on Selection.
 * Feature: Allow changing the color of the selection mask via View → Set Selection Mask Color.
 * Feature: Make selections mask brush strokes. Can be toggled via Selection → Mask Brush Strokes With Selection. Thanks Bluestrings for testing.
 * Feature: Switch pixel compression algorithm to zstd, which is many times faster than the old gzip. Thanks Bonbli for suggesting a way to get better compression with this.
 * Feature: Don't require paste permission for transforms that modify the opacity or blend mode.
 * Feature: Allow alpha locking layers. This basically works the same as enabling alpha lock on the tool you're using, it's just there for people that are used to doing it this way from other programs.
 * Feature: Allow locking layer properties to avoid accidentally changing e.g. the blend mode.
 * Feature: Allow locking layer positions to avoid accidentally moving them. Thanks Athena for suggesting.
 * Feature: Increase canvas size limit to up to 1 million pixels as long as the total canvas size doesn't exceed 1073676289 pixels (32767 squared). Previously each dimension was limited to 32767 instead. Thanks johannesCmayer and yvantot for suggesting and MajorCooke for testing.
 * Feature: A Drawpile 2.2 compatibility mode, allowing you to join sessions hosted with the previous version. Thanks lambda20xx for testing.
 * Feature: Add shortcuts that switch tools and deselect in a single action. Thanks Bonbli for suggesting.
 * Feature: New .dpcs canvas file format that's much faster and in most cases also leads to smaller sizes. Thanks Bonbli for suggesting an optimization to this; CosmosX007, Fanshen and hpar for reporting issues.
 * Feature: A gradient tool, which works inside of selections. Thanks ChristianJohnsten, lambda20x, Malrn and Maffi for suggesting.
 * Feature: Preview brushes with fixed X and Y offsets with an offset outline. Thanks Phoneme for suggesting.
 * Fix: Don't mark the canvas as having unsaved changes from just making a selection on it. Thanks MachKerman for reporting.
 * Fix: Don't include credentials in the URL when opening a new window on reconnect, they're only for use in the same window. Thanks MachKerman for reporting.
 * Fix: Save and restore smudge minimum value properly instead of resetting it to zero.
 * Feature: Add jitter setting for classic brushes, available in the brush settings. This setting offsets the dabs from the center of the stroke, useful for pencil, charcoal or spraycan brushes.
 * Feature: Show the time it took to open, save and export files in the status bar.
 * Fix: Don't disconnect when receiving an unknown message from user 0. Thanks Blozzom and unsername for reporting.
 * Fix: Compensate jagged curves in when using the lasso select tool. Thanks Blozzom for reporting.
 * Feature: Make arrow keys navigate the animation timeline when it has focus. Thanks MorrowShore for suggesting.
 * Feature: Add support for opening and exporting images in Quite Okay Image Format (QOI).
 * Feature: Add -B/--background-color option to drawpile-timelapse command to set an override background color. Thanks Bluestrings for suggesting.
 * Feature: Add a "synchronize smudging" brush setting. This will make the brush stroke wait for itself before smudging, which is slower, but required for some smudge brushes to work properly when making fast strokes. Thanks Donatello and xxxx for reporting.
 * Feature: Allow classic brushes to smudge with transparency. This can be toggled in the brush settings. The old mode now calls itself "blending" instead to be able to tell it apart. Thanks xxxx for suggesting and lambda20xx for testing.
 * Feature: A lasso fill tool, bound to Shift+F by default. Thanks EvilKitty3, Fallen, Geese, MorrowShore and Juzeror for suggesting, Blozzom and Bonbli for suggesting additions to it.
 * Feature: Allow pressing Escape (or whatever you bound "cancel action" to) to deselect. Can be disabled in the tool preferences. Thanks RannyBergamotte for suggesting.
 * Feature: Upscale small animations by whole numbers to fill the flipbook view. Can be toggled using the zoom button at the bottom. Thanks Ian700ng for suggesting.
 * Fix: Properly stop flood fills at selection boundaries. Thanks Bluestrings for reporting.
 * Feature: Allow assigning keyboard shirtcuts to tool blend modes. Thanks Izzy and Meru for suggesting.
 * Fix: Don't reattach detached brushes when switching slots. Thanks MachKerman for reporting.
 * Feature: Show tooltips of tool buttons immediately, so that you can tell better what they do without having to wait for them.
 * Fix: Don't switch away from a detached brush when only right-clicking, just like it works when you disable brush detaching altogether. Thanks MachKerman for reporting.
 * Feature: Harmony swatches, showing color harmonies for the current color to make palettes or shade with. Can be enabled and configured through the hamburger by right-click menu on the color wheel. Thanks tiar for suggesting.
 * Fix: Don't allow toggling toolbars in small screen mode, since they will just reappear again. Thanks CosmosX007 for reporting.
 * Feature: Add View → Always Show Side/Bottom Toolbar actions to let you choose whether to always show those toolbars in small screen mode or only when something is folded out using the tabs on the side. Thanks CosmosX007 for suggesting.
 * Fix: Add some space to the sides of the bottom toolbar in small-screen mode so that the undo and record buttons don't get eaten by rounded corners. Thanks March for reporting.
 * Feature: Allow reordering and toggling which drawing tools are visible in the toolbar, via e.g. Tools → Configure drawing toolbar. Thanks MorrowShore for suggesting.
 * Feature: Add OKLAB blend mode for layers and brushes. Thanks Bonbli for contributing.
 * Fix: Detect eraser pen tip on Android, since the eraser doesn't report it's in proximity until it hits the surface, similar to the browser. Thanks CosmosX007 for reporting.
 * Feature: Auto-correct attempts to host on http(s) sites by extracting the host portion from them. Thanks Charmandrigo for suggesting.
 * Feature: Add shortcuts to change brush opacity and hardness. Thanks justanotatest for suggesting.
 * Feature: Allow defining a separate pressure curve for the stylus eraser tip in the tablet preferences. Thanks CosmosX007 for suggesting.
 * Feature: Allow turning off system file dialogs on Windows, in case they somehow cause trouble. Thanks CrustStuff for suggesting.
 * Fix: Remember loops field in animation export dialog during a single run, instead of resetting it to 1 every time.
 * Feature: Allow swapping the sides of docks, toolbars and on-canvas buttons via View → Left-Handed Mode in small screen mode. Thanks yoossy for suggesting.
 * Feature: Redirect handling in the client, allowing servers to forward connections to other servers, with the option of only accepting signed redirects.
 * Server Feature: Session thumbnail generation, by requesting the client to generate one. Currently only through the web admin API, thumbnails are not displayed anywhere or generated automatically yet.
 * Feature: Add pixel-perfect option for pixel brushes, available in the brush editor and under the paint mode dropdown. Thanks Meru and Squishy for suggesting, lan700ng for testing.
 * Feature: Use the canvas background color or the color behind the canvas as the background color for the annotation editor, depending on where the annotation is placed. Thanks Blozzom for suggesting.
 * Feature: Add a build for Windows on ARM. Thanks fizbin for testing.

Unreleased Version 2.2.3-pre
 * Fix: Disable audio playback under 32 bit Windows, since it just crashes.
 * Fix: Clear text in the annotation tool when deselecting, since it makes it seem like you can still type in there.
 * Feature: Allow setting hostaddress, hostpass, username and userpass URL parameters in the browser, as a workaround for when you can't type anything into the text fields. Thanks N8theGr8 for bringing this up.
 * Server Fix: Properly prefer users with better OS, net quality or ping for autoresets, even if they responded first. Thanks Blozzom for reporting.
 * Fix: Don't reselect default layer after picking a layer from the canvas or via the timeline. Thanks Meru for reporting.
 * Fix: Properly snap pixel brush outlines in the correct spot and don't snap soft brush outlines at all. Thanks Meru for reporting.
 * Fix: Disable color wheel preview on macOS, since it breaks dragging on the wheel like it does on Android. Thanks Millie for reporting.
 * Feature: Let operators create annotations beyond the 256 per-user maximum. Like with layers, this will use annotations of user 0 first, then 255, 254 etc. Thanks to Devil Like Me for reporting.
 * Server Feature: Add settings to filter disallowed user and session names. Thanks Bluestrings for suggesting.
 * Server Feature: Allow marking individual sessions as unlisted, as well as a setting to automatically unlist all or browser-hosted sessions. Thanks Bluestrings for suggesting.
 * Server Feature: Allow adding server log entries via API. Thanks Bluestrings for suggesting.
 * Server Feature: Add a "browser" flag to the API, to be able to tell whether a user is connected via web browser.
 * Feature: Assigning colors to layers and key frames. Thanks MorrowShore and hpar respectively for suggesting.
 * Fix: Don't crash on some systems when selecting multiple layers and merging them. Thanks cromachina for reporting.
 * Fix: A rare crash when faced with a lot of identically-named brushes assigned to the same shortcut. Thanks Blozzom for reporting.
 * Fix: Allow changing the background color when you have background permissions, previously it checked for canvas resize permission instead.
 * Fix: Make fill tool apply to the layer it was executed on when "edit pending fills" is disabled. Thanks Greendyno for reporting.
 * Fix: Don't set a 0% opacity layer to 1% opacity when switching it out of sketch mode. Thanks Meru for reporting.
 * Fix: Properly reset layer visibility when creating a layer with the same ID as a previously hidden layer when you have a high-ish ping. Thanks MachKerman for reporting.
 * Fix: Don't start a kinetic scroll of the surrounding view when trying to adjust curve or slider. Thanks 3rd_EFNO for reporting.
 * Fix: Make MyPaint brushes not pick up transparency from outside of the canvas. Thanks Meiren and yvantot for reporting.
 * Fix: Properly render sketch mode layers when the actual layer opacity is zero.
 * Feature: Smoothing for touch panning, zooming and rotation. Can be configured and disabled in the touch preferences. Thanks Jay-Man for suggesting, 3rd_EFNO and lan700ng for testing.
 * Fix: Remove warning about Firefox on Android not supporting pressure sensitivity, since it does now. Thanks tiar for reporting.
 * Feature: Make Drawpile build on the Haiku operating system again. Thanks Begasus for contributing.
 * Server Fix: Interpret the connection quality setting sent by clients correctly when choosing who to pick for autoresets. Thanks Blozzom and grimsley for reporting.
 * Fix: Correct warning about Firefox on Linux not supporting pressure sensitivity, since it does work on some systems. Thanks Kuuuube for reporting.
 * Feature: Add pressure tester to browser startup page. Thanks Shivani for contributing.
 * Feature: Add language selector to browser startup page.
 * Feature: Add a brush setting to disallow others in a session to use it. This does not prevent them from replicating the brush in other ways, but this setting is there if you feel strongly about not making it easy. Thanks Blozzom for suggesting.
 * Fix: Don't crash on macOS when inputting an invalid session address to join. Thanks Charmandrigo for reporting and Axocrat for testing.
 * Fix: Restore normal layer view mode when loading a canvas into the same window.
 * Fix: Replace the notification sound playback backend, which should make it work on Android, the Linux AppImage and on 32 bit Windows. It should hopefully also no longer have occasional crashes on some Linux and Windows systems.
 * Server Fix: The server now checks whether it can actually start with a GUI if you run it without arguments on Linux and other non-macOS Unix systems, rather than trying it and crashing because you don't have a graphical environment. Thanks Epiglottal Axolotl for reporting.
 * Server Feature: Add a --no-gui option to explicitly run the server without a graphical shell.
 * Feature: Bind deselect to both Ctrl+Shift+A and Ctrl+D by default, since other software is inconsistent in this regard. Thanks Geese for suggesting.
 * Fix: Make click detection more sensitive, to avoid accidentally creating tiny selections when trying to just click to deselect. Thanks Bluestrings for reporting.
 * Feature: Donation and feedback links. They don't cause any extra pop-ups, but if they annoy you regardless, they can be summarily disabled in the preferences.
 * Fix: Make the hardware renderer work on macOS.
 * Feature: Clean up the Mac menu. Menu items that were missing when no window were added, items that went into the application menu are now also in the place where they are on every other system and newly opened windows don't start with a missing canvas.
 * Fix: Don't crash on Android when toggling MyPaint brush parameters via touch. Thanks Manuart for reporting.
 * Fix: Work around iPads and iPhones refusing to let you pick ORA, PSD and other file types that it doesn't know by just allowing you to pick all file types. Thanks DevonJP for reporting, Axocrat and Scruff for testing.

2025-03-26 Version 2.2.2
 * Fix: Make annotations not cause glitches when moving them around when using the software renderer. Thanks Meru for reporting.
 * Feature: Add -u/--users parameter to dprectool, which will print out a table of user statistics along with names and ids.
 * Feature: Add --include-user-ids parameter to dprectool, allowing to pass a comma-separated list of user ids to only include visual changes from.
 * Fix: Work around WebKit bug 284752 that prevents Drawpile from working on Safari 18. Thanks grimsley for reporting.
 * Fix: Correct weird letter spacing in the font rendering on Windows. Thanks Sinamer for reporting.
 * Feature: Make reset images a bit smaller and much faster. This speeds up manual session resets, canvas compression, hosting and joins in the builtin server. Thanks mukihyena for reporting.
 * Fix: Generate the catchup image in the background when hosting on the builtin server, rather than hanging the client. Thanks mukihyena for reporting.
 * Server Fix: Additional checks and logging to avoid and diagnose temporary failures in streamed resets. Thanks Will for reporting.
 * Fix: Slightly delay restoring dock layouts after the window is resized to avoid a crash on macOS. Thanks Axocrat for reporting.
 * Fix: Properly update the checkbox on View > Full Screen if the OS forces the application out of it. Thanks Sinamer for reporting.
 * Fix: Restore window maximized after exiting the application from full screen mode. Thanks Sinamer for reporting.
 * Fix: Only remember dock sizes when the window is maximized or full screen on operating systems where that's possible to tell. Thanks Meiren for reporting.
 * Fix: Make tablet positions work on Cintiqs under Windows Ink with UI scaling and when it's not set to be the primary monitor. The old behavior is available via Edit > Tablet Driver > Windows Ink Non-Native, in case this breaks something else. Thanks Axocrat and Liz for reporting, Weenifer for reporting and testing, Maffi for reporting additional issues.
 * Fix: Remove the "KisTablet" prefix from the tablet driver names in Windows, it's a technical name that doesn't add anything useful.
 * Feature: Indicate when you have no layer selected so that it doesn't seem like you can draw but nothing happens.
 * Server Fix: Remove browser users when a session's password is removed and the server only allows browsers in passworded sessions. Thanks Bluestrings for reporting.
 * Server Feature: Add a separate permission for hosting via browser and whether to take this permission from ext-auth. This also fixes the issue where it would ask you to log in when trying to host from the browser, just to then tell you that you're not allowed to do so anyway. Thanks Bluestrings for suggesting.
 * Removed Feature: Username lists in external session announcements. They were never used.
 * Fix: Show current tier in the layer permissions menu again. Thanks Meiren for reporting.
 * Fix: Reduce selection outline resolution instead of punting to the blue selection mask when it gets too large. Thanks Meru, MorrowShore and Shane for reporting.
 * Server Feature: Invite codes, allowing inviting people with revokable links that override regular session restrictions. Thanks Bluestrings and Liz for suggesting.
 * Removed Feature: Toggling between web and direct links in the invite dialog. Drawpile will translate the web link if you paste it into the join dialog anyway, so the distinction was pointless.
 * Fix: Change temporary tool switch setting text to say that only the primary shortcut will cause it. This was unintentional, but it's useful. Thanks 3rd_EFNO for reporting.
 * Fix: Use proper background images in Windows installer instead of those ugly red discs. Thanks evilTriangle for reporting.
 * Fix: Correct intermittent errors when connecting, reconnecting or otherwise opening a new main view in the browser that could hang the application.
 * Feature: Allow hiding the color history swatches on individual color docks. Thanks Stickly for suggesting.
 * Fix: Make pan, zoom, inspector and color picker tools not get locked by the session catching up or resetting. Thanks Greendyno for reporting.
 * Fix: Don't show canvas during catchup when using software renderer.
 * Fix: Fix keyboard shortcuts, enter and backspace not reacting on some devices in the browser. Thanks Greendyno for reporting.
 * Fix: Keep leading spaces and zeroes the same when creating or duplicating a layer. Thanks Greendyno for reporting.
 * Feature: Allow making the application full-screen in the browser, using View > Full Screen. Thanks Windy for suggesting.
 * Fix: Make user markers not leave streaks in the software renderer when fractional UI scaling is involved. Thanks lambda20xx for reporting.
 * Feature: Add constrain and center buttons to the transform tool, for the equivalent of holding Shift and Alt when you don't have a keyboard. Thanks MachKerman for suggesting.
 * Fix: Don't crash on invalid certificates when connecting via WebSocket. Thanks IZUHU for reporting.
 * Feature: Set user agent header when connecting via WebSocket using the client. Thanks Meru for suggesting.
 * Feature: Allow adding a "w" query parameter to session URLs to connect via WebSocket instead. Thanks IZUHU for suggesting.
 * Fix: Remember whether a host was connected to via WebSocket by adding the "w" query parameter to it.
 * Server Feature: Add a "prefer WebSockets" option. Clients will generate appropriate invite links and announcements will contain this preference.
 * Server Fix: Allow refreshing external bans even when the section is locked. Thanks Bluestrings for reporting.
 * Feature: Add -i/--image option to the drawpile-cmd command, to allow e.g. converting an ORA to a PNG file or similar on the command line.
 * Feature: Add PSD and WEBP format support to the drawpile-cmd command.
 * Fix: Don't reset reference dock position when toggling dock visibility. Thanks izzy for reporting.
 * Fix: Remove language selection in the web version for now, since it doesn't do anything. Thanks Albano Battistella for reporting.
 * Feature: Allow setting the language in the web version using a query parameter. Many languages don't work properly, but this allows setting it before starting the thing and then having to change it.
 * Fix: Show and select existing track title when renaming it. Thanks Greendyno for reporting.
 * Fix: Properly resize login dialog on Android when showing session listings so that you can actually read something.
 * Fix: Don't make kinetic touch scrolling jerk around when moving the finger over the scroll bar.
 * Fix: Properly linkify URLs with an @ in the path.
 * Fix: Default kinetic scroll on Android and the browser to left-click, since that works better and also covers touch.
 * Fix: Allow dragging layers and sliding across the checkboxes in the layer list even when kinetic scrolling with left-click or touch is enabled by making the left and right areas not react to scroll. This is a patch to Qt.
 * Fix: Work around a crash on Windows when toggling kinetic scroll settings.
 * Fix: Properly show current layout on first layouts dialog run. Thanks Dib for reporting.
 * Fix: Disable image reader limit in command-line tools under Qt6.
 * Fix: Deduplicate brush and tag names when exporting brushes. Thanks Blozzom for reporting.
 * Fix: Don't crash under Windows 7 when attempting to play two sounds once. Thanks pachuco for reporting.
 * Server Feature: Allow configuring filter regular expressions for usernames and session titles. One expression to remove allow-listed parts and one to block disallowed ones.
 * Fix: Work around a rare crash when reordering layers on Windows. Thanks Momo for reporting.

2025-02-12 Version 2.2.2-beta.5
 * Feature: Color circle dock with gamut masks, available through View > Docks > Color Circle. Similar to Krita's Artistic Color Selector and MyPaint's HSV/HCY Wheel.
 * Fix: Make temporary tool switches by holding a key down work again. Thanks 3rd_EFNO and bunnie for reporting.
 * Fix: Disregard hidden layers when layer picking in frame view.
 * Feature: Add a search bar to the key frame properties dialog.
 * Fix: Reset locale to "C" after Qt messes it up on startup. Thanks Meru for reporting.
 * Fix: Don't use bilinear interpolation in transforms unnecessarily.
 * Feature: Add canvas shortcuts for changing color hue, saturation/chroma and value/lightness/luminosity. Thanks Dann DeCairns for suggesting.
 * Feature: Make size adjustment canvas shortcut depend on the speed of the drag. Thanks MorrowShore for suggesting.
 * Fix: Remove pointless permissions on Android that Qt includes by default but aren't actually used.
 * Fix: Don't default Android to fingerpaint when a pen is present.
 * Fix: Work around a crash on Android that sometimes occurs when putting your palm on the screen, which somehow leads to touch events with zero contact points. Thanks Mav for reporting.
 * Fix: Uncap aspect ratio on older Android versions. Thanks Molderche for reporting.
 * Fix: Work around modifier keys not registering when using a tablet on Wayland. Thanks Absolute Goober for reporting.
 * Server Fix: Don't pointlessly reload server certificates if they didn't change. Thanks Liz for reporting.
 * Server Fix: Work around too many authenticated users in a session, which could cause a crash. Thanks Liz for reporting.
 * Fix: Don't crash when filling with feathering and a canvas-filling selection. Thanks Meru for reporting.
 * Fix: Don't carry over HUD button presses to dock UI in small screen mode. Thanks Meru for reporting.
 * Feature: Make list action buttons in settings dialog clearer, adding an edit button for canvas shortcuts. Thanks Maffi for suggesting.

 * Fix: Make clicking and dragging fill and magic wand tools work at all zoom levels and drag speeds.
 * Feature: Make the canvas resize dialog fit to a floating transform, if present. This allows you to paste an image larger than the canvas and then resize to fit. Thanks Meru for suggesting.
 * Server Fix: Don't filter out feature access messages when loading session templates, so that permissions can actually get set properly from them.
 * Feature: Add --pass/-p option to dprectool, to allow configuring which messages are passed through when converting. The default is to pass all messages through, rather than just messages relevant for the client.
 * Server Feature: Treat invalid password and opword hashes in session templates as plain passwords. This still issues a warning, since those kinds of passwords should really be specified by prefixing them with "plain;".
 * Server Fix: Make template sessions not appear with a blank title and settings when first joining them.
 * Server Fix: Properly include web socket allowance in template session listings.
 * Server Feature: Allow authOnly option in session templates.
 * Server Fix: Allow joining a non-instantiated templated session via a direct link to its alias, rather than telling the user that the session isn't up.
 * Server Fix: Properly start recordings for sessions instantiated from a template.
 * Fix: Try to retain dock arrangements after resizing the window, the Windows on-screen keyboard squashing the application or rotating a device/monitor. They should no longer remain squished to a smaller size after resizing the window back. Thanks vipperz for reporting.
 * Fix: Work around Android devices reporting way too huge motions when panning with two fingers. Thanks quandaledingle44 for reporting.
 * Feature: Right-clicking outside of a transform now applies it. Thanks MorrowShore for suggesting.
 * Feature: Allow dragging selections to quickly move their contents without having to double-click to deselect and dragging the edge to move the selection itself without its contents. Thanks Blozzom, Lungy, MorrowShore, SadColor and Zheida for suggesting and testing.
 * Fix: Don't mark the canvas as saved if it was only exported.
 * Fix: Round colors to 8 bits in fill and magic wand tools so that they don't get snagged on color differences too small to see on screen. Thanks vipperz for reporting.
 * Feature: Add -I/--interpolation option to the drawpile-cmd and drawpile-timelapse commands, to allow using better scaling than bilinear if appropriate. Thanks Saphiros for causing this.
 * Fix: Don't add blank filenames to recent files list. Thanks Aries Raenidaez for reporting.
 * Fix: Don't reset zoom and rotation when lifting and replacing one of two fingers in a pinch or twist operation. Thanks Partack for reporting.
 * Fix: Stop tap-and-hold color picking when another finger is added.
 * Fix: Use Normal blending in Layer View and Group View modes. Thanks Meru for reporting.
 * Feature: Show different cursors for selection replace, unite, exclude and intersect operations. Thanks MorrowShore for suggesting.
 * Fix: Take canvas rotation, mirror and flip into account with regards to pen tilt inputs.
 * Fix: Adjust minimum resolution for desktop-screen mode to be a bit larger, to avoid getting a cut-off desktop UI on some phones.
 * Fix: Don't cut off the bottom of dialogs on some Android phones. Thanks Anonymous, Bluestrings and Molderche for reporting.
 * Fix: Work around Gaomon tablets reporting pen buttons as mouse inputs. They were getting ignored because of an earlier Huion bug workaround.

 * Feature: Remember background color as well when using per-slot colors.
 * Fix: Scroll to the brush in question when creating or overwriting one.
 * Feature: Allow editing brush names, descriptions and thumbnails when using detached slots.
 * Fix: Make next/previous brush and tag shortcuts work when using detached slots.
 * Server Feature: Inform clients of session password changes so that they can update their invite links.
 * Fix: Work around the web browser receiving messages while the application is handling messages already. This could cause nonsensical errors like "incompatible server" or "invalid state" or outright crashes during login.
 * Server Feature: Allow filtering server logs via the web admin API. Thanks Bluestrings for suggesting.
 * Fix: Properly save background color of annotations in ORA files.
 * Feature: Allow toggling a "sketch mode" on layers, which will change the opacity and/or tint the layer locally. The exact look of this can be configured in the layer properties. Thanks abrasivetroop and leandro2222 for suggesting.
 * Feature: Use the sketch mode tinting for onion skins as well, since it gives better results when there's colored areas involved.
 * Fix: Properly update rotation when choosing an angle from the drop-down in the status bar when the angle is fractionally off the chosen angle. Thanks annoy for reporting.
 * Server Feature: Allow locking admin API sections to prevent changes on them, optionally with a password that needs to be entered to unlock them.
 * Server Feature: Only treat WebSocket connections from browsers (based on the presence of an Origin header) as requiring extra permissions, to allow desktop and mobile clients to connect via WebSockets without being subjected to extra restrictions.
 * Server Feature: Allow hosting passworded sessions via the browser if password-dependent sessions are enabled, rather than refusing hosting altogether.
 * Server Feature: Allow restricting connections to the correct host name as passed with --local-host. Enabling this requires an updated client, since older ones don't transmit the hostname.
 * Fix: When setting the canvas background color, the dialog now properly previews colors with alpha instead of showing them as opaque.
 * Feature: Add File > Export Again to let you export to the same file without showing a file picker. Thanks gerroon for suggesting.
 * Fix: Properly save flipbook crop for when cropping multiple times without resetting in-between. Thanks BornIncompetence for reporting.
 * Feature: Allow selecting and then moving, grouping, deleting etc. of multiple layers at once. To select multiple layers, hold Shift or Ctrl while making a selection or use the boxes on the right. Thanks MorrowShore for suggesting parts of this.
 * Feature: Allow dragging across the layer icons to hide the visibility of multiple layers in a row, rather than having to click each one. Thanks MorrowShore for suggesting.
 * Feature: The fill and magic wand tools now always at least fill the initial pixel if gap closing or shrinking would up with a blank result. Thanks MorrowShore for suggesting.
 * Fix: Properly apply transforms if the only thing you change is the opacity or blend mode. Thanks Blozzom for reporting.
 * Feature: Add Blue Apatite, Indigo, Ocean Deep, Pool Table, Rose Quartz, Rust and Watermelon color schemes. Thanks Weenifer for contributing.
 * Fix: Use the Fusion style by default on macOS because the System style has crashing bugs when using it with Sidecar. Thanks Axocrat for reporting.
 * Fix: Make the software renderer not create errant dark lines when moving the cursor when fractional scaling is involved. Thanks lambda20xx for reporting.
 * Fix: Remove nonsensical license page from Windows installer, Drawpile isn't under the kind of license that requires the user to accept it.
 * Fix: Properly open ORA, PSD and brush pack ZIP files when dragging them over the window. Thanks MorrowShore for reporting.
 * Fix: Don't show laser trails while catching up. Thanks MorrowShore for reporting.

 * Fix: Allow disabling the application proxy in the network preferences and automatically detect bad proxy configurations that can't actually make connections. Thanks FishEggsThe for reporting.
 * Fix: Improve socket error messages, listing the error code and adding extra information on what to do if a proxy error occurs. Thanks FishEggsThe for reporting.
 * Fix: Center soft brushes on the cursor better, they got offset to the top-left from correcting for size discontinuity before. Thanks Meiren for reporting.
 * Fix: Don't mess up gridmap settings when opening brush settings dialog and initially changing a value in it. Thanks Blozzom for reporting.
 * Fix: Default "confirm action" to both the regular enter key as well as the one on the numpad. Thanks MachKerman for reporting.
 * Feature: Add settings button to color wheel, sliders and palette at the top-left of the dock. For the wheel, this allows changing the settings here now instead of having to go into the preferences. For the sliders, you can now toggle the color space here and decide whether to show all sliders and the hex input. For the palette, this just moves the menu button that used to be in the row below. Thanks MachKerman for suggesting.
 * Feature: Allow aligning the color wheel to the top of the dock instead of the center. Can be toggled in the dock's menu. Thanks MorrowShore for suggesting.
 * Fix: Scale outer color wheel ring with the size of the widget. Thanks MorrowShore for reporting.
 * Feature: Preview selected color on the color wheel. Can be toggled in the dock's menu. Thanks MorrowShore for suggesting.
 * Fix: Allow pressing the numpad enter key to apply an action and Ctrl+Equal in addition to Ctrl+Plus to zoom in. Thanks MachKerman and Sinamer for reporting.
 * Fix: Prevent artifacts around brush cursor when the canvas is rotated in software renderer mode. Thanks Sinamer for reporting.
 * Fix: Don't consider the flood fill's own preview when filling the merged image. Thanks Meru for reporting.
 * Server Feature: Streamed autoresets that don't interrupt the session to bring it down to a smaller size, instead the compressed state is built up in the background and replaced on the fly.
 * Fix: Make joining through a direct link not put the desktop client into single-session mode. Thanks Bluestrings for reporting.
 * Fix: Work around Huion tablets emitting mouse clicks every few pen presses and causing full-pressure strokes to be started. Thanks Blozzom, DT and and Dumb Dog Disease for reporting.
 * Feature: Toggle layer visibility action, available in the Layer menu. Mostly useful to let assign a keyboard shortcut to it. Thanks incoheart for suggesting.
 * Feature: Remember ranges set for MyPaint brushes in the settings editor, rather than implicitly fitting them to the curve. Thanks Verdrusk for suggesting.
 * Server Feature: Provide more session status information for administrators, such as the autoreset state.
 * Feature: Allow importing MyPaint brushes in old version formats instead of saying they contain invalid JSON. Thanks bunnie for suggesting.
 * Feature: Attach brushes to slots, showing which brush you selected and remembering changes to them. This attachment can be disabled in the tool preferences.
 * Feature: Allow configuring the number of brush slots in the tool settings, from 1 to 9, in addition to the everpresent eraser slot. Thanks vipperz for suggesting.
 * Fix: Clamp palette swatch sizes to more reasonable bounds. Thanks MachKerman for reporting.
 * Server Feature: Allow checking session, operator and server account passwords via the API. This can be used to password-protect recordings or similar. Thanks Meru for contributing.
 * Fix: Correct some UI scaling problems with brush outlines, canvas centering, dock toggling, pixel grid and transform handles. Thanks annoy for reporting.
 * Feature: Extended touch tap gestures, among them two-finger tap to undo, three-finger tap to redo and tap-and-hold to summon the color picker. Can be configured in the preferences under the Touch tab. Thanks InconsolableCellist and many others for suggesting.
 * Feature: Snap canvas rotation around 0° by default. If you don't want this, you can set the canvas shortcut or touch rotation to "free rotate canvas" instead.
 * Feature: Show a color preview when picking a color from the canvas. Can be toggled in the tool preferences.
 * Fix: In layer view mode, render the layer truly in isolation instead of applying opacities, visibilities or alpha preserve to it. Thanks MachKerman and incoheart for reporting.
 * Feature: Add Layer > Group View to show the parent group of the current layer in isolation. Thanks Rylan for suggesting.
 * Fix: Save and export images according to the current view mode. Thanks incoheart for reporting.
 * Server Fix: Don't get announcement refreshes stuck in an infinite loop. Thanks Meru for reporting.
 * Fix: Make MyPaint brushes not ignore the first stroke made with them. This would also sometimes lead to a blank preview.
 * Feature: Allow choosing between a round and square expansion/shrinking kernel in flood fill, magic wand and when altering a selection. The latter is particularly useful for pixel art. Thanks Bigcheese and MorrowShore for suggesting.
 * Fix: Don't ignore double-clicks when toggling layer visibility or check state. Thanks Chryssabliss for reporting.
 * Feature: Put all shortcuts onto a single settings page, showing conflicts between them better. Allow searching for shortcuts by name and keybinding, as well as filtering out only conflicts. Thanks MajorCooke for suggesting parts of this.
 * Feature: Allow assigning keyboard shortcuts to brushes. Assigning the same shortcut to multiple brushes will toggle through them. Thanks annoy for suggesting.
 * Server Feature: Integrate with systemd watchdog.
 * Fix: Make user interface scaling not round to multiple of 100% anymore. Thanks blau, Buch, Chryssabliss and ShotgunnerFox for reporting.
 * Fix: Don't use system message boxes on Android, since they behave in various broken and nonsensical ways, like showing you a yes button three times.  Thanks Hopfel for reporting.
 * Feature: Use hardware renderer on Android by default.
 * Fix: Don't unnecessarily scale full-canvas animations by a single pixel.
 * Feature: Replace GIF export with ffmpeg's libraries, since they are also used for videos. It's way faster, generates much better palettes and supports transparent backgrounds. Thanks dAVePAGE and JJ for reporting issues in this regard.
 * Fix: Constrain aspect ratio of transform scaling properly, it was getting offset by the distance between the clicked point and the actual corner. Thanks Blozzom for reporting.
 * Feature: Allow configuring flood fill preview and confirmation behavior, defaulting to the simplest mode similar to single-user software, but still previewing fills locally first. The magic wand always works this way for now, since selections are local only anyway.
 * Feature: Show resize dialog when expanding canvas, to avoid accidental resizes and improve performance by doing the expansions all in one step. The keyboard shortcuts to expand the canvas work in this dialog now and also auto-repeat if you hold them down. Thanks Bluestrings and tobiasBora for suggesting things in this regard.
 * Fix: Indicate denied permissions by showing a message to that effect, rather than just disabling the actions and leaving you guessing. Thanks Venesio for reporting.
 * Fix: Clicking off of an annotation will no longer instantly create a new one in that spot. It will instead only deselect the annotation that was selected.
 * Fix: The Delete Empty Annotations can now be undone without undoing what happened before it as well.
 * Feature: Empty annotations are now automatically deleted when you deselect them, to avoid the common clutter of stray empty annotations across the canvas. If you really did want an empty annotation, you can hit undo and it will return.
 * Server Feature: Setting a minimum protocol version of dp:4.24.0 now tells clients that they're using a Drawpile version too old for this server, rather than leaving them sitting at a session list where they can join no sessions.
 * Feature: Allow clicking and dragging the fill and magic wand tools to adjust the tolerance.
 * Fix: Make mouse click canvas shortcuts not override key canvas shortcuts. Thanks incoheart for reporting.
 * Server Feature: Always allow server admins, moderators and users with the new PERSIST flag to toggle session persistence. The global persistence setting still allows anyone to toggle this. Thanks Bluestrings for suggesting.
 * Server Feature: Allow admins to specify a linger time for empty sessions, which will let even non-persistent sessions live on for that time to allow people a chance to reconnect.
 * Server Feature: Add API endpoints to get and create session listings. Thanks Meru for contributing.
 * Fix: Make login dialog not spill off-screen on mobile devices.

2024-08-09 Version 2.2.2-beta.3
 * Fix: Use more accurate timers for performance profiles if the platform supports it.
 * Fix: Don't try to update the roles list before becoming an operator, which could lead to a crash. Thanks Bluestrings for reporting.
 * Fix: Don't update sessions that were just added to the session browser, since that can lead to a crash because of what is probably a bug in Qt's filtering and sorting. Thanks Bluestrings for reporting.
 * Feature: Turn too large transforms into cut and paste operations instead of cancelling them outright.
 * Fix: Make frame import not create a track with an invalid ID that messes up the UI. Thanks BulletPepper and greendyno for reporting.

 * Fix: Load annotations from ORA files saved by Drawpile 2.1 properly. Thanks RyanMolyneux for reporting.
 * Feature: Ignore inputs with invalid pressure during strokes. Thanks Lunalatte for reporting.
 * Server Fix: Handle sessions running out of space better, they should no longer end up in an unrecoverable state. The messages in chat are also now translatable, more informative and don't get spammed for every command. Thanks Bluestrings and Charmandrigo for reporting.
 * Feature: Lock canvas when the session is out of space, showing an appropriate message in the corner, rather than letting you continue drawing. The server needs to be updated for this to be available.
 * Server Fix: Make catchup not take pointlessly long when the session is out of space.
 * Feature: Add a message to the reset dialog that you need to be an operator to reset the session, since it's not too clear why the button is disabled otherwise.
 * Feature: Make fill source selection a set of buttons for merged image, merged without background and layer, using the dropdown only for the latter thereof. The checked button will be remembered. Thanks Blozzom, Bluestrings and Meru for suggesting.
 * Feature: Default redo to both Ctrl+Y and Ctrl+Shift+Z on Windows, Linux and the browser. Thanks Crow for suggesting.
 * Fix: Brighten up transparency checkerboard to be a bit easier on the eyes. Thanks Crow for suggesting.
 * Server Feature: Allow registered users to replace themselves when rejoining a session, rather than telling them that their own name is in use. Avoids having to wait for their old self to time out if their internet flakes. Thanks Crow for suggesting.
 * Fix: Don't fail server compilation when turning off webadmin or WebSockets. Thanks leegean for reporting.
 * Fix: Save and load annotation vertical alignment to and from ORA files.
 * Fix: Put a transparent background behind flat images, rather than using white. Thanks lungy for reporting.
 * Fix: Make pasting images from Drawpile into other applications retain transparency on Windows. This is really a bug in those other programs, they pick the wrong format by default, but whatever. Thanks lungy for reporting.
 * Feature: Allow configuring the transparency checkerboard colors in the user interface preferences. Thanks lungy for suggesting.
 * Fix: Don't reselect and scroll back to default layer after interacting with the layer list by picking a layer or toggling visibility. Thanks MachKerman and Ben for reporting.
 * Fix: Load PNGs even when they have corrupt checksums. Thanks xxxx for reporting.
 * Feature: Allow copying multiple entries from the event log. Thanks Bluestrings for reporting.
 * Feature: Allow toggling vertical sync in the user interface preferences. Default is off, because it can cause input lag.
 * Feature: Web browser support for the client.
 * Feature: New hardware and software canvas renderers. The hardware renderer is much faster than the old one, especially in the browser. Uses Direct3D on Windows, WebGL in the browser and OpenGL on all other platforms. The software renderer is slightly faster than the old one, useful for cursed hardware or drivers that cause input lag or visual glitches. This is an experimental feature and can be enabled in the General preferences under Renderer.
 * Feature: Add system information dialog under Tools > Developer Tools > System Information.
 * Feature: Hide user pointers when they get close to your cursor. Can be toggled under View > User Pointers > Hide From Cursor. Thanks Crowley for suggesting.
 * Feature: Allow filling non-continuous areas. Thanks Ben for suggesting.
 * Fix: Make rotation via View > Rotation > Rotate Canvas (Counter-)Clockwise work properly when it's mirrored or flipped. Thanks Ragged for reporting.
 * Feature: Allow disabling the zoom, rotation, mirror and flip on-canvas notices in the User Interface preferences. Thanks Partack for suggesting.
 * Feature: Allow configuring user pointer stay time through View → User Pointers → Stay Time. Thanks johannesCmayer for suggesting.

 * Fix: Focus existing layer properties dialog if one exists for the layer that properties are requested for.
 * Feature: Name layers after the username of the creator by default.
 * Fix: Don't use bilinear interpolation when selection is only moved, rotated by a multiple of 90 degrees, flipped or mirrored, to avoid unnecessary blurring. Thanks lungy for reporting.
 * Feature: Don't require restarting the application when changing kinetic scrolling settings.
 * Fix: Change default canvas size to 2000x2000, because 800x600 is a bit outdated. Thanks MorrowShore for for contributing.
 * Feature: Don't require restarting the application to switch between desktop and small screen mode. There's also a "dynamic" option now, which will change the mode based on the size of the window, enabled by default on Android and in the browser.
 * Feature: Pan or "hand" tool. Lets you move the canvas around by clicking. Thanks DeeJii for suggesting.
 * Fix: Don't move view position when pressing side buttons in small screen mode.
 * Feature: Show a proper explanation when you can't join a session.
 * Fix: Make autosave interval actually be in minutes, not in seconds because that's ridiculous. Thanks D'mitri for reporting.
 * Feature: Add -U/--uncensor parameter to drawpile-timelapse to allow revealing censored layers.
 * Fix: Reduce contrast on censor tile stripes to make them less annoying to look at.
 * Server Feature: When you pass an option that's not compiled in, the error message will not inform you of that fact, rather than just saying you passed an unknown option with no further information.
 * Feature: On Windows and Linux, new windows now open in a separate process, since that's more efficient and resilient. Can be disabled by setting the DRAWPILE_SINGLE_PROCESS environment variable. Thanks Bluestrings for suggesting.
 * Fix: The main window should now properly restore to its previous position even when that's on a secondary screen. Thanks Moe for reporting.
 * Removed Feature: Roomcodes. They are a vestige from a time where Drawpile only had a single, central listing server. Nowadays nobody uses these anymore, invite links are the replacement.
 * Feature: Disable global smoothing for mouse drawing by default, since that really only make sense for tablets and touch. Can be toggled in the input preferences. Thanks nililfin for suggesting.
 * Feature: Always show drawing tools toolbar in small screen mode. Thanks Blozzom for suggesting.
 * Fix: Increase contrast on depressed buttons in dark themes. This is a patch to Qt. Thanks MorrowShore for reporting.
 * Fix: Switch out the icon for the extension buttons on squashed menus and toolbars so that they're actually visible in dark themes. This is a patch to Qt.
 * Feature: Make canvas zoom slider use the same increments as the mouse wheel and zoom in/out actions, since stepping by 1% is not useful. Thanks zheida for suggesting.
 * Fix: Work around a crash on Linux that happens when hosting with busted versions of Qt 6.6+. Thanks Vanska for reporting.
 * Fix: Allow tabbing the main window on macOS again, for some reason Qt disabled it. This is a patch to Qt. Thanks mira for reporting.
 * Feature: Pixel ruler, available under View > Show Rulers. Thanks fluttershydev for contributing.
 * Fix: Ignore mouse clicks caused by briefly touching the canvas on some devices on Windows. Thanks sfin for reporting.
 * Feature: Translate links copied out of the browser version of Drawpile into something that can be joined when they are pasted into the join page.
 * Feature: Better small-screen mode handling. The toggle items now no longer overlap, dialogs get maximized if appropriate, the start and settings dialogs get arranged horizontally.
 * Feature: Rework selections and transforms entirely. They're now distinct operations. Selections participate in the undo stack.
 * Feature: Allow toggling between accurate and fast transform previews. The former is the current kind of preview that actually gets previewed on the layer, the latter is like in Drawpile 2.1, where it's just a vector image drawn on top of everything.
 * Feature: Allow picking blend modes and opacity when pasting, stamping and transforming. Thanks blurymind for suggesting.
 * Feature: Show layouts action in dock menus. Thanks Elisa for suggesting.
 * Fix: Set TCP_NODELAY on sockets to reduce unnecessary latency.
 * Feature: Build option -DPROXY_STYLE=ON to fix the bad contrast in dark themes when not building a patched version of Qt yourself.

 * Feature: Indicate fill source in layer list.
 * Fix: Make canvas lock and layers not lock tools that don't actually act on them.
 * Feature: Allow transforming multiple layers at once.
 * Feature: Make creating a key frame layer copy the layer structure of the closest frame if that's assigned to a layer group. Thanks Ausjamcian for suggesting.
 * Fix: Don't overwrite last file on save after resetting the canvas to an external image. Thanks Bluestrings for reporting.
 * Fix: Ignore bogus mouse clicks emitted by some tablets after briefly tapping the pen on them. Thanks Ausjamcian for reporting.
 * Fix: Make the window fit itself to the screen harder in the browser and on Android. There's also an option under View -> Fit to Screen now to manually force it to do so. Thanks Sidca for reporting and Meru for testing.
 * Feature: Allow importing animation frames from multiple files and as layers from PSD files, to be found under File -> Import. Thanks Meru, BulletPepper, Ben and RubberRoss for suggesting.
 * Feature: Extend animation export to be a dialog where you pick the format. You can now export frames to a ZIP, allowing Android and the browser to save a series of frames as well. Exporting to MP4 and WEBM videos as well as animated WEBP is also implemented via ffmpeg's libraries.
 * Feature: Magic wand select tool. Basically a fill tool, but for selections. Thanks ChristianJohnsten for suggesting.
 * Fix: Properly remember NSFM setting in host dialog. Thanks Bluestrings and cupcake for reporting.
 * Fix: Properly check NSFM setting in host dialog based on title if that is configured in the parental controls preferences. Thanks Bluestrings for reporting.
 * Fix: Behind blend mode now does opacity math correctly. Thanks Blozzom for reporting.
 * Fix: Allow cancelling fill tool with right-click even when that's bound to something else. Thanks SadColor for reporting.
 * Feature: The fill tool now previews fills instead of doing them immediately, allowing cancelling and changing layers before applying it. You can also pick more blend modes, change the opacity and fill the entire selection with it now.
 * Fix: Make layer picking work properly in frame mode, it picked the bottom-most instead of the top-most one.
 * Feature: Add View > Show Selection Mask, which lets you view selections as a solid mask instead of an outline. This lets you see opacity properly.
 * Removed Feature: Zeroconf support, an obscure LAN-only discovery thing that wasn't working anymore anyway.
 * Fix: Make the fill tool not feather along canvas edge. Thanks Meru for reporting.
 * Server Feature: Allow specifying idleOverride and allowWeb in session templates. Thanks MorrowShore for suggesting.
 * Feature: Allow shrinking fills and magic wand selections. Thanks Meru for suggesting.
 * Feature: New dialog Selection > Expand/Shrink/Feather Selection that alters selections accordingly. Thanks MorrowShore for suggesting.
 * Feature: Zooming with keyboard shortcuts now zooms in on the cursor when it's pointing at the canvas. If you don't like this, there's new shortcuts that always zoom on the center, which you can bind in the preferences. Thanks Chryssabliss for suggesting.
 * Feature: Make header and footer buttons on docks stretch further if there's empty space, making them easier to hit. Thanks MorrowShore for suggesting.
 * Fix: Properly truncate files when writing them on Android to avoid corruption from leftover junk at the end.
 * Feature: Allow cropping in the drawpile-timelapse command-line tool using -x/--crop.
 * Fix: Compensate for discontinuity in the classic soft brush radius to make the transition look less bumpy. Thanks BulletPepper for reporting.
 * Feature: Make color sliders dock smaller by showing only one set of sliders at a time and add an input field for a hex color name. Thanks Kawaxte and MorrowShore for suggesting.
 * Fix: Don't switch tools while typing into text fields in some situations. Thanks leopardheart982 for reporting.
 * Fix: Give color wheel, color palette and navigator docks a minimum size so that they can't be shrunken into nonexistence. Thanks vipperz for reporting.
 * Fix: Don't remove layer censors when resetting sessions hosted on the builtin server. Thanks O_O for reporting.
 * Server Feature: Allow changing session founder names through the admin API.
 * Feature: Don't pop open chat for session auto-resets, just show a note in the corner of the canvas. Needs both client and server to be updated.
 * Feature: Support reading and writing WEBP files.
 * Feature: Enable high-DPI scaling by default on all platforms except Android. Can be disabled in the user interface preferences if needed.
 * Fix: Default kinetic scrolling on Android to touch instead of left click, since the latter conflicts with stuff like dragging layers.
 * Fix: Allow importing role lists larger than 100 entries, since public sessions have those. Thanks kale for reporting.

2024-02-25 Version 2.2.2-beta.1
 * Server Feature: Allow adding a message when kicking someone through the admin API.
 * Fix: Don't mess up strokes when hitting undo while still actively drawing them. Thanks Sinamer for reporting.
 * Fix: Properly reset angle when undoing a point with the curve tool.
 * Server Feature: Log more a more detailed reason when a client is disconnected, since something like a login error can have many causes.
 * Feature: Indicate the difference between self-signed and "real" server certificates.
 * Fix: Rename "trusted hosts" to "pinned certificates", because that's what they are.
 * Fix: Make floating docks stay on top of the main window on macOS. Thanks 6ix for reporting and testing.
 * Feature: Add a dual color button, showing the foreground and background color, with the ability to set, swap and reset them.

 * Fix: Show web join allowance checkbox in session settings properly, it didn't show up if disabled before.
 * Server Feature: Allow making joining via the browser dependent on if the session has a password or not.

2024-02-18 Version 2.2.1
 * Fix: Default to previous directory when saving a fresh file. Thanks Crow for reporting.
 * Feature: Allow toggling performance-related canvas view settings, since some systems get slowdowns. Thanks DevonJP for reporting.
 * Fix: Don't force TLS socket algorithms, since ECDSA certs seem to not like them. Thanks Bluestrings for reporting.
 * Fix: Log message queue read, write and timeout errors properly. Thanks Pepper for reporting.
 * Feature: Implement WebSocket support in the server, available with the --websocket-port and --websocket-listen options.
 * Feature: Send keepalive messages from the server, if the client indicates support for it. Avoids them disconnecting when too busy uploading to send a ping.

 * Fix: Don't act like keep aspect ratio is checked when resizing from a selection. Thanks Meru for reporting.
 * Fix: Make onion skin color partially transparent by default so that they don't turn into solid blocks on colored stuff. Thanks BulletPepper for reporting.
 * Fix: Clarify the host dialog by adding additional messages that explain common sources of confusion, such as the title being required, disallowing invite links as the title, the password being necessary to host a private session and "host on this computer" requiring port forwarding.

 * Feature: Render flipbook frames in the background and indicate that fact with a loading spinner. It no longer lags the UI and gets done faster because of multithreading.
 * Feature: Crop flipbook when a selection is present upon opening it.
 * Feature: Make the flipbook UI clearer. The buttons now look like buttons, the uncrop button has a better icon and only shows while the view is cropped and the speed slider shows how many FPS you're actually running at.
 * Fix: Allow saving and loading files in weird Android folders that chew up the file names internally.
 * Server Feature: Allow servers to have a rules text that users are prompted to accept upon connecting. Clients remember that they accepted the rules and won't prompt again unless they changed since last time.

 * Fix: Apply color wheel direction to color dialogs too. Thanks Blozzom for reporting.
 * Fix: Don't smoothe the canvas view when at 100% zoom with the canvas rotated at a right angle, since that just blurs it for no reason. Thanks SadColor for reporting.
 * Fix: Make flipbook shortcut work while the flipbook is in focus, causing it to refresh its view.
 * Fix: Cap flipbook range properly, rather than letting you set a range beyond the last frame.
 * Fix: Remove the useless "?" button from dialogs in Windows. Thanks vipperz for reporting.

 * Feature: Bring back dprectool, the command-line tool that converts Drawpile recordings. It should work mostly the same as it did in Drawpile 2.1.
 * Feature: Apply parent folder opacity to frames within it, useful for sketch tracks. Thanks to TeaLord9000 for suggesting.
 * Feature: Add a "small screen" mode, which should make the application usable on phones. Thanks to Verdrusk for suggesting.
 * Feature: Allow changing the application font size, rather than using the system default that may be garbage, especially on Android. Also Verdrusk's fault.
 * Feature: Locking docks now also locks toolbars, rather than still allowing you to move them around on accident.
 * Feature: Kinetic scrolling. This lets you click/tap/touch scrollable stuff and fling it around instead of using the scroll bars or wheel. Configurable in the preferences. Thanks again Verdrusk.
 * Fix: Make two-finger zoom and rotation not go completely crazy when the canvas is mirrored or flipped. Thanks BoyOnion for reporting.

 * Feature: Implement drawpile-timelapse, a new command-line tool that turns Drawpile recordings into timelapse videos.
 * Server Feature: Add --web-admin-allowed-origin option, to set the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to the given value. Particularly useful for development, where you don't particularly want to set up an nginx to make CORS happy. Thanks Chem for reporting.
 * Server Feature: Update the server to use the 2.2 protocol.

 * Feature: Allow choosing ffmpeg path on Windows. Thanks xxxx for suggesting.
 * Fix: Move brushes to the proper place in MediBang-esque layout. Thanks xxxx for reporting.

 * Feature: Allow the client to translate server messages, rather than having them always be in English.
 * Fix: Make preferences dialog not use custom layouts anymore. Fixes the dialog getting stuck at an unusably tiny size on Windows, makes it work with Arabic and other right-to-left languages and allows resizing the dialog as well as scrolling its contents.
 * Fix: Drag-zooming (Ctrl+Middle Click by default) now zooms on the initial click location, rather than the center of the canvas. Thanks to Valaek for reporting.
 * Fix: Don't select layer when toggling its visibility.
 * Fix: Show a crossed-out folder icon for hidden layer groups, rather than switching to the layer icon for them. Thanks to Blozzom for reporting.
 * Fix: Make catchup explicit. Solves both the "stuck at 99%" problem during session resets and the canvas too be unlocked too early.
 * Fix: Give erase mode its own icon so that it doesn't get confused for the eraser slot. Thanks Geese for reporting.
 * Feature: Show if the current brush is in erase or alpha lock mode in the toolbar and allow resetting it via a click. Thanks Geese for suggesting.

 * Feature: Show a notice when there's no tracks yet, rather than just showing an empty timeline grid.
 * Fix: Actually pick color when adding a color to the color picker through the color dialog.
 * Feature: Mark window when a chat message is received. On Windows, this makes the icon in the task bar orange. On macOS, it supposedly bounces an icon somewhere. On other platforms it probably does something similar, indicating which window is the one that got a message ready. Thanks Radio for suggesting.
 * Fix: Don't add current color to the palette when creating it. Thanks xxxx for reporting.
 * Fix: Make exported palettes not start using the exported location to save changes to. Thanks xxxx for reporting.

 * Feature: Make canvas rendering and preview painting asynchronous. This should make the UI much more responsive when e.g. changing layer visibility or transforming a large selection.
 * Fix: Properly handle canvas resizes while transforming a selection, it now no longer causes the source of the transform to get offset.
 * Fix: Show the current color properly on program startup.
 * Feature: Make the color wheel innards go from least to most saturated, putting it in line with how most other software presents it. This can be toggled in the preferences.

 * Feature: Implement brush export and make the brush import also understand classic brushes.
 * Fix: Make erasing with MyPaint brushes in indirect mode actually work.
 * Feature: Make sliders adhere to the chosen color space. Thanks to leandro2222 for suggesting.
 * Feature: Increase font size on emoji posted into chat. Thanks to leandro2222 for suggesting.
 * Feature: Allow adding an avatar from the login dialog.
 * Fix: Show main window maximized by default, because who wants a drawing program in a tiny window.
 * Fix: Give docks sensible initial sizes. Thanks to xxxx for reporting.
 * Fix: Don't tabify the now invisible-by-default timeline and onion skins by default. Thanks Ben for finding.
 * Fix: Make the flipbook remember your last crop, frame range and playback speed for the current window. Thanks Ben for finding.
 * Fix: Don't mark guests as registered. Thanks to xxxx for reporting.
 * Fix: Allow assigning a shortcut to open the Layouts dialog (F9 by default) and to the entries in the Help menu (nothing by default.)

2023-07-31 Version 2.2.0-beta.6

 * Fix: Lock timeline controls when the canvas or user is locked.
 * Feature: Allow adding key frames and an associated layer or group with a single action.
 * Feature: Allow duplicating key frames along with their contents.

 * Fix: Slow down user markers only for MyPaint brushes and snappy for classic brushes as well as when a new line is started.
 * Feature: Add a flipbook button to the timeline dock.
 * Feature: Hide the indirect mode button in the brush dock instead of just disabling it, since it's hard to tell the difference otherwise.
 * Fix: Fixed a crash when resizing the canvas while an indirect stroke is in progress.
 * Feature: Allow viewing tile and draw context memory usage in the statistics dialog.
 * Server Fix: Make the server GUI exist again, it got lost in the build scripts.

 * Fix: Make the canvas view not jigger anymore when you zoom it out at certain sizes.
 * Fix: Lock drawing when the user is locked.
 * Fix: Make KisTablet Windows Ink the default tablet driver on Windows, because the Qt one is pretty busted.
 * Fix: Re-synchronize the canvas when local desynchronization is detected, rather than just keeping going with a broken state for ages.
 * Fix: Don't reset the layer properties dialog when someone else changes a layer. This would cause renames to get reverted to the original name, for example, which is really annoying.
 * Fix: Make default layer actually select itself when joining a canvas.
 * Fix: Move notifications to their own preferences page, since the network page was out of room and squashed some controls.
 * Fix: Make preference notes larger so that they work better in non-Latin writing systems.

 * Server Feature: Expedite listing refreshes when something important changes, like the NSFMness, title or closedness of a session.
 * Server Fix: Make the server GUI compatible with Qt6.
 * Fix: Make layer picking and the inspector pay attention to the layer view mode, so that picking layers when animating works properly.

 * Feature: Allow including session passwords into URL.
 * Feature: Implement an invite dialog, to make it easier to directly let people join a session without listing it publicly.
 * Feature: Show a warning when joining an NSFM session, since it might not be obvious to new users what they're in for.
 * Fix: Make newlines show up properly when the chat is in context mode.
 * Fix: Handle key presses and releases while dragging the canvas, since some people start the drag before pressing the key and would like their inputs to not be ignored.
 * Fix: Wrap server title in the login dialog to make it not stretch the window into eternity.
 * Fix: Allow opening links in the server title. They were turned into links, but those couldn't actually be clicked.
 * Feature: Implement a start dialog instead of dumping the user into a blank canvas and making them pick through the menu at the top. Replaces the join, host, new and update dialogs, unifying them into a single one instead that should reduce the number of clicks required to do pretty much anything.
 * Fix: Properly disable the NSFM session setting when it can't be changed.
 * Fix: Make the color palette work properly again, it was broken in various ways. Also makes the color picker look like it used to in 2.1.
 * Feature: Add a button to the color picker to pick from the screen.
 * Feature: Allow focusing the canvas by double-tapping the Alt key, as well as an assignable shortcut for it, which is Ctrl+Tab by default.
 * Feature: Show coordinates in the view status bar.
 * Fix: Put resize arrows at the corners of the selection, rather than offset on the far ends.
 * Fix: Don't displace selection by some subpixel amount when moving it around.
 * Fix: Prioritize sending of pings and pongs so that a lot of queued messages don't cause a disconnect.
