Unreleased Version 2.2.0-pre
 * Fix: Make classic brushes not go brighter when smudging into transparency. Thanks to cada for reporting.
 * Feature: "Ratchet" canvas rotation shortcut, using Alt+Shift by default. Rotates the canvas in 15° increments. Thanks to Kvothen for suggesting.
 * Fix: Don't filter out undo depth messages when playing back recordings.
 * Fix: Make floating docks restore properly again. Thanks SnazComic for reporting.
 * Fix: Don't show tag options when right-clicking on a brush preset. Thanks Blozzom for reporting.
 * Fix: Properly disable blend mode combo box in layer properties dialog. Thanks xxxx for reporting.
 * Fix: Move chat status bar button into a legal position. Thanks Flz for reporting.
 * Fix: Correct various errors in text recording reading and writing.
 * Fix: Don't keep locally forked canvas states around. This reduces memory usage by a bunch, especially when drawing locally.
 * Feature: Add layer on current key frame button is now in the top bar of the timeline, next to the other key frame buttons. Thanks FallenArts for suggesting.
 * Feature: Show a notice when there's no tracks yet, rather than just showing an empty timeline grid.
 * Fix: Actually pick color when adding a color to the color picker through the color dialog.
 * Feature: Mark window when a chat message is received. On Windows, this makes the icon in the task bar orange. On macOS, it supposedly bounces an icon somewhere. On other platforms it probably does something similar, indicating which window is the one that got a message ready. Thanks Radio for suggesting.
 * Fix: Don't add current color to the palette when creating it. Thanks xxxx for reporting.
 * Fix: Make exported palettes not start using the exported location to save changes to. Thanks xxxx for reporting.

 * Fix: Don't claim that a layer is locked when it's just not visible in the current frame.
 * Feature: Make canvas rendering and preview painting asynchronous. This should make the UI much more responsive when e.g. changing layer visibility or transforming a large selection.
 * Fix: Properly handle canvas resizes while transforming a selection, it now no longer causes the source of the transform to get offset.
 * Fix: Show the current color properly on program startup.
 * Feature: Make the color wheel innards go from least to most saturated, putting it in line with how most other software presents it. This can be toggled in the preferences.
 * Feature: Holding Shift while moving a selection now keeps it along the closest axis. Thanks Kvothen for suggesting.

2023-07-31 Version 2.2.0-beta.6
 * Fix: Don't forget account password when entering a wrong session password.
 * Fix: Smoothe out the timing of strokes received over the network to not make them appear jerky because of the paint engine drawing them too fast.
 * Fix: Lock timeline controls when the canvas or user is locked.
 * Feature: Allow adding key frames and an associated layer or group with a single action.
 * Feature: Allow duplicating key frames along with their contents.
 * Fix: Put changing the timeline frame count behind a button, since it might get mixed up with the current frame on accident.
 * Fix: Slow down user markers only for MyPaint brushes and snappy for classic brushes as well as when a new line is started.
 * Feature: Add a flipbook button to the timeline dock.
 * Feature: Hide the indirect mode button in the brush dock instead of just disabling it, since it's hard to tell the difference otherwise.
 * Fix: Fixed a crash when resizing the canvas while an indirect stroke is in progress.
 * Feature: Allow viewing tile and draw context memory usage in the statistics dialog.
 * Server Fix: Make the server GUI exist again, it got lost in the build scripts.

 * Fix: Make the canvas view not jigger anymore when you zoom it out at certain sizes.
 * Fix: Lock drawing when the user is locked.
 * Fix: Make KisTablet Windows Ink the default tablet driver on Windows, because the Qt one is pretty busted.
 * Fix: Re-synchronize the canvas when local desynchronization is detected, rather than just keeping going with a broken state for ages.
 * Fix: Don't reset the layer properties dialog when someone else changes a layer. This would cause renames to get reverted to the original name, for example, which is really annoying.
 * Fix: Make default layer actually select itself when joining a canvas.
 * Fix: Move notifications to their own preferences page, since the network page was out of room and squashed some controls.
 * Fix: Make preference notes larger so that they work better in non-Latin writing systems.
 * Fix: Make the password page of the login dialog not so annoyingly large.
 * Feature: Clarify when asking for a session password versus an account password.
 * Fix: Handle duplicated shortcuts by complaining about it, rather than doing nothing.
 * Feature: Add shortcuts to move the canvas around, for people who want to do it with something other than the arrow keys.
 * Feature: Enable auto-repeat for shortcuts where it's sensible, such as zooming, moving the canvas, undo, redo or switching between layers, frames and tracks.
 * Feature: Allow clicking and dragging the inspector around, so that it's easier to hit small sections.
 * Fix: Don't fire an assertion when moving a selection out of bounds. This is not an error.
 * Fix: Default color wheel to HSV mode, not HSL.
 * Fix: Stretch columns of the ban list so they don't look so weirdly cut off.
 * Fix: Don't revert settings with a default value that have an old version of some other value.
 * Server Feature: Relay listing errors to the client, rather than leaving them in silence.
 * Server Feature: Add maximum user count and closed state to listings.
 * Server Feature: Expedite listing refreshes when something important changes, like the NSFMness, title or closedness of a session.
 * Server Fix: Make the server GUI compatible with Qt6.
 * Fix: Make layer picking and the inspector pay attention to the layer view mode, so that picking layers when animating works properly.
 * Fix: Allow pixel brushes to have a minimum of zero pixels, rather than treating both 0 and 1 as 1.
 * Fix: Make chat line not scroll into oblivion when dragging over it.
 * Fix: Make the UI not mess up the sizes of docks and chat when starting it on Windows.
 * Fix: Make brush outline update even when docks are hidden.
 * Feature: Make Linux AppImage more compatible with older Linuxes.
 * Fix: Make secure connections work in the Linux AppImage.
 * Feature: Automatically join a session when given a URL on startup, rather than waiting for another button press.
 * Feature: Allow including session passwords into URL.
 * Feature: Implement an invite dialog, to make it easier to directly let people join a session without listing it publicly.
 * Feature: Show a warning when joining an NSFM session, since it might not be obvious to new users what they're in for.
 * Fix: Make newlines show up properly when the chat is in context mode.
 * Fix: Handle key presses and releases while dragging the canvas, since some people start the drag before pressing the key and would like their inputs to not be ignored.
 * Fix: Wrap server title in the login dialog to make it not stretch the window into eternity.
 * Fix: Allow opening links in the server title. They were turned into links, but those couldn't actually be clicked.
 * Feature: Implement a start dialog instead of dumping the user into a blank canvas and making them pick through the menu at the top. Replaces the join, host, new and update dialogs, unifying them into a single one instead that should reduce the number of clicks required to do pretty much anything.
 * Fix: Properly disable the NSFM session setting when it can't be changed.
 * Fix: Make the color palette work properly again, it was broken in various ways. Also makes the color picker look like it used to in 2.1.
 * Feature: Add a button to the color picker to pick from the screen.
 * Feature: Allow focusing the canvas by double-tapping the Alt key, as well as an assignable shortcut for it, which is Ctrl+Tab by default.
 * Feature: Show coordinates in the view status bar.
 * Fix: Put resize arrows at the corners of the selection, rather than offset on the far ends.
 * Fix: Don't displace selection by some subpixel amount when moving it around.
 * Fix: Prioritize sending of pings and pongs so that a lot of queued messages don't cause a disconnect.
 * Fix: Make filtering closed sessions actually work.
 * Feature: Make the server browser columns resizable.
 * Feature: Allow filtering duplicates in the server browser.

 * Fix: Avoid colors tending toward black when smudging.
 * Fix: Make the cursors for the line, rectangle, ellipse and curve tools look less skrunkly.
 * Fix: Prefer Drawpile's own icons over system icons, to avoid nonsensical icons being used on Linux.
 * Translation: German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese (Portugal), Russian, Simplified Chinese, Spanish, Turkish.
