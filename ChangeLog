 * Fix: Load annotations from ORA files saved by Drawpile 2.1 properly. Thanks RyanMolyneux for reporting.
 * Feature: Ignore inputs with invalid pressure during strokes. Thanks Lunalatte for reporting.
 * Server Fix: Handle sessions running out of space better, they should no longer end up in an unrecoverable state. The messages in chat are also now translatable, more informative and don't get spammed for every command. Thanks Bluestrings and Charmandrigo for reporting.
 * Feature: Lock canvas when the session is out of space, showing an appropriate message in the corner, rather than letting you continue drawing. The server needs to be updated for this to be available.
 * Server Fix: Make catchup not take pointlessly long when the session is out of space.
 * Feature: Add a message to the reset dialog that you need to be an operator to reset the session, since it's not too clear why the button is disabled otherwise.

 * Fix: Save and load annotation vertical alignment to and from ORA files.
 * Fix: Put a transparent background behind flat images, rather than using white. Thanks lungy for reporting.

 * Feature: Allow configuring the transparency checkerboard colors in the user interface preferences. Thanks lungy for suggesting.
 * Fix: Don't reselect and scroll back to default layer after interacting with the layer list by picking a layer or toggling visibility. Thanks MachKerman and Ben for reporting.
 * Fix: Load PNGs even when they have corrupt checksums. Thanks xxxx for reporting.
 * Feature: Allow copying multiple entries from the event log. Thanks Bluestrings for reporting.
 * Feature: Allow toggling vertical sync in the user interface preferences. Default is off, because it can cause input lag.
 * Feature: Web browser support for the client.
 * Feature: New hardware and software canvas renderers. The hardware renderer is much faster than the old one, especially in the browser. Uses Direct3D on Windows, WebGL in the browser and OpenGL on all other platforms. The software renderer is slightly faster than the old one, useful for cursed hardware or drivers that cause input lag or visual glitches. This is an experimental feature and can be enabled in the General preferences under Renderer.
 * Feature: Add system information dialog under Tools > Developer Tools > System Information.
 * Feature: Hide user pointers when they get close to your cursor. Can be toggled under View > User Pointers > Hide From Cursor. Thanks Crowley for suggesting.

 * Feature: Don't require restarting the application when changing kinetic scrolling settings.
 * Fix: Change default canvas size to 2000x2000, because 800x600 is a bit outdated. Thanks MorrowShore for for contributing.
 * Feature: Don't require restarting the application to switch between desktop and small screen mode. There's also a "dynamic" option now, which will change the mode based on the size of the window, enabled by default on Android and in the browser.
 * Feature: Pan or "hand" tool. Lets you move the canvas around by clicking. Thanks DeeJii for suggesting.
 * Fix: Don't move view position when pressing side buttons in small screen mode.
 * Feature: Show a proper explanation when you can't join a session.
 * Fix: Make autosave interval actually be in minutes, not in seconds because that's ridiculous. Thanks D'mitri for reporting.

 * Fix: Reduce contrast on censor tile stripes to make them less annoying to look at.
 * Server Feature: When you pass an option that's not compiled in, the error message will not inform you of that fact, rather than just saying you passed an unknown option with no further information.
 * Feature: On Windows and Linux, new windows now open in a separate process, since that's more efficient and resilient. Can be disabled by setting the DRAWPILE_SINGLE_PROCESS environment variable. Thanks Bluestrings for suggesting.
 * Fix: The main window should now properly restore to its previous position even when that's on a secondary screen. Thanks Moe for reporting.
 * Removed Feature: Roomcodes. They are a vestige from a time where Drawpile only had a single, central listing server. Nowadays nobody uses these anymore, invite links are the replacement.
 * Feature: Disable global smoothing and jagged curve compensation for mouse and touch drawing by default, since those don't really only make sense for pen tablets. Can be toggled in the input preferences. Thanks nililfin for suggesting.
 * Feature: Always show drawing tools toolbar in small screen mode. Thanks Blozzom for suggesting.
 * Fix: Increase contrast on depressed buttons in dark themes. This is a patch to Qt. Thanks MorrowShore for reporting.
 * Fix: Switch out the icon for the extension buttons on squashed menus and toolbars so that they're actually visible in dark themes. This is a patch to Qt.
 * Feature: Make canvas zoom slider use the same increments as the mouse wheel and zoom in/out actions, since stepping by 1% is not useful. Thanks zheida for suggesting.
 * Fix: Work around a crash on Linux that happens when hosting with busted versions of Qt 6.6+. Thanks Vanska for reporting.
 * Fix: Allow tabbing the main window on macOS again, for some reason Qt disabled it. This is a patch to Qt. Thanks mira for reporting.

 * Feature: Make the flipbook UI clearer. The buttons now look like buttons, the uncrop button has a better icon and only shows while the view is cropped and the speed slider shows how many FPS you're actually running at.
 * Fix: Allow saving and loading files in weird Android folders that chew up the file names internally.
 * Server Feature: Allow servers to have a rules text that users are prompted to accept upon connecting. Clients remember that they accepted the rules and won't prompt again unless they changed since last time.

 * Fix: Apply color wheel direction to color dialogs too. Thanks Blozzom for reporting.
 * Fix: Don't smoothe the canvas view when at 100% zoom with the canvas rotated at a right angle, since that just blurs it for no reason. Thanks SadColor for reporting.

 * Feature: Bring back dprectool, the command-line tool that converts Drawpile recordings. It should work mostly the same as it did in Drawpile 2.1.
 * Feature: Apply parent folder opacity to frames within it, useful for sketch tracks. Thanks to TeaLord9000 for suggesting.
 * Feature: Add a "small screen" mode, which should make the application usable on phones. Thanks to Verdrusk for suggesting.

 * Feature: Locking docks now also locks toolbars, rather than still allowing you to move them around on accident.
 * Feature: Kinetic scrolling. This lets you click/tap/touch scrollable stuff and fling it around instead of using the scroll bars or wheel. Configurable in the preferences. Thanks again Verdrusk.
 * Fix: Make two-finger zoom and rotation not go completely crazy when the canvas is mirrored or flipped. Thanks BoyOnion for reporting.

 * Feature: Implement drawpile-timelapse, a new command-line tool that turns Drawpile recordings into timelapse videos.
 * Server Feature: Add --web-admin-allowed-origin option, to set the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to the given value. Particularly useful for development, where you don't particularly want to set up an nginx to make CORS happy. Thanks Chem for reporting.
 * Server Feature: Update the server to use the 2.2 protocol.

 * Feature: Allow the client to translate server messages, rather than having them always be in English.
 * Fix: Make preferences dialog not use custom layouts anymore. Fixes the dialog getting stuck at an unusably tiny size on Windows, makes it work with Arabic and other right-to-left languages and allows resizing the dialog as well as scrolling its contents.
 * Fix: Drag-zooming (Ctrl+Middle Click by default) now zooms on the initial click location, rather than the center of the canvas. Thanks to Valaek for reporting.
 * Fix: Don't select layer when toggling its visibility.
 * Fix: Show a crossed-out folder icon for hidden layer groups, rather than switching to the layer icon for them. Thanks to Blozzom for reporting.
 * Fix: Make catchup explicit. Solves both the "stuck at 99%" problem during session resets and the canvas too be unlocked too early.
 * Fix: Give erase mode its own icon so that it doesn't get confused for the eraser slot. Thanks Geese for reporting.
 * Feature: Show if the current brush is in erase or alpha lock mode in the toolbar and allow resetting it via a click. Thanks Geese for suggesting.
 * Feature: Paste in center of the canvas (instead of the center of the view) when the pasted image size is equal to or larger than the canvas size. Thanks Meru for suggesting.

 * Feature: Show a notice when there's no tracks yet, rather than just showing an empty timeline grid.
 * Fix: Actually pick color when adding a color to the color picker through the color dialog.
 * Feature: Mark window when a chat message is received. On Windows, this makes the icon in the task bar orange. On macOS, it supposedly bounces an icon somewhere. On other platforms it probably does something similar, indicating which window is the one that got a message ready. Thanks Radio for suggesting.
 * Fix: Don't add current color to the palette when creating it. Thanks xxxx for reporting.
 * Fix: Make exported palettes not start using the exported location to save changes to. Thanks xxxx for reporting.

 * Fix: Properly handle canvas resizes while transforming a selection, it now no longer causes the source of the transform to get offset.
 * Fix: Show the current color properly on program startup.

 * Fix: Lock drawing when the user is locked.
 * Fix: Make KisTablet Windows Ink the default tablet driver on Windows, because the Qt one is pretty busted.
 * Fix: Re-synchronize the canvas when local desynchronization is detected, rather than just keeping going with a broken state for ages.
 * Fix: Don't reset the layer properties dialog when someone else changes a layer. This would cause renames to get reverted to the original name, for example, which is really annoying.
 * Fix: Make default layer actually select itself when joining a canvas.
 * Fix: Move notifications to their own preferences page, since the network page was out of room and squashed some controls.

 * Fix: Wrap server title in the login dialog to make it not stretch the window into eternity.
 * Fix: Allow opening links in the server title. They were turned into links, but those couldn't actually be clicked.
 * Feature: Implement a start dialog instead of dumping the user into a blank canvas and making them pick through the menu at the top.
